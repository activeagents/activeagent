# Rails is the Best Framework for Building AI Apps

<v-click>

*Yes, better than Python frameworks*

</v-click>

<v-click>

*Yes, better than Node.js*

</v-click>

<v-click>

*Yes, I'm serious*

# Why Rails? Because We've Solved the Hard Parts

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 pt-4">

<div>

### What Rails Provides

<v-clicks>

- **Convention over Configuration**
- **ActiveRecord** for data persistence
- **ActionCable** for real-time streaming
- **ActiveJob** for background processing
- **Mature ecosystem**

</v-clicks>

</div>

<div>

### For AI, This Means

<v-clicks>

- Less AI boilerplate
- Natural conversation storage
- Streaming responses built-in
- Long-running generations
- Auth, deployment, monitoring solved

</v-clicks>

</div>

</div>

<!--
"While others are building auth systems, we're building AI features"
"Rails conventions eliminate 80% of the AI integration complexity"

# Current AI Development is a Mess

```python {all|2|3|4|5|6|7}
# Every Python AI app reinvents these wheels:
- Session management
- User authentication  
- Background processing
- WebSocket handling
- Database migrations
- API versioning
```

# Active Agent
## AI Agents as Rails Controllers

```ruby {all|2|3-5|all}
class SupportAgent < ApplicationAgent
  def answer_question
    @question = params[:question]
    prompt  # It's just a Rails view!

Agents inherit from controllers. It's that simple.

# Reduce Complexity Through Convention

### Without Active Agent

<v-clicks>

- Configure prompt templates
- Set up message threading
- Wire up tool definitions

### With Active Agent

```bash
rails generate active_agent:agent Support answer_question

# Questions?

### Common Questions We Anticipate:

1. How does this compare to LangChain?
2. What about Python's ML ecosystem?
3. Does this work with Rails 7.x?
4. How do you handle rate limiting?
5. What's the performance overhead?
