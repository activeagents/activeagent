Description:
    Generates a new agent and its views. Passes the agent name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of actions as arguments.

    This generates an agent class in app/agents and invokes your template
    engine and test framework generators. If no ApplicationAgent exists,
    it will be created automatically.

    Views are created for each action in three formats:
    - HTML (.html.erb) - for rich text responses
    - Text (.text.erb) - for plain text responses  
    - JSON (.json.erb) - for structured function calling responses

Examples:
    `bin/rails generate active_agent:agent inventory search`

    creates an inventory agent class, views, and test:
        Agent:      app/agents/inventory_agent.rb
        Views:      app/views/inventory_agent/search.html.erb
                    app/views/inventory_agent/search.text.erb
                    app/views/inventory_agent/search.json.erb
        Test:       test/agents/inventory_agent_test.rb

    `bin/rails generate active_agent:agent inventory search update report`

    creates an inventory agent with search, update, and report actions.

    `bin/rails generate active_agent:agent admin/user create --template-engine=haml`

    creates a namespaced admin/user agent with Haml templates.
