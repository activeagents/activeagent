**The scene: A Mar-a-Lago fundraiser masquerading as a tech summit. A burger costs $47, but at least it comes with classified documents as napkins. Outside, democracy weeps. Inside, the future is being auctioned to the highest bidder.**

## I. "It Was Beautiful and Nothing Worked"

**Jensen**: *[adjusting his leather jacket]* Every startup needs GPUs. $40,000 per H100. It's not price gouging, it's "enabling the future."

**Sam**: GPT-5 will change everything. We're on the exponential curve to AGI. Just need another hundred billion and—

**The Engineer**: Another hundred billion to make autocomplete 5% better? Kurt Vonnegut wrote "Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt." Silicon Valley's epitaph will read "Everything was beautiful and nothing worked."

**Trump**: *[interrupting]* I invented AI. True story. Nobody did AI before me. We're going to have the best AGI, tremendous AGI—

**Jack Ma**: *[genuinely puzzled]* I still don't understand. Computer cannot think. Computer follows instructions. Why do you pretend otherwise?

**Wei**: In Beijing, we're achieving similar results with a fraction of the compute. Perhaps because we focus on engineering rather than mythology.

**Elon**: *[tweeting while talking]* Grok will be based. It'll tell the truth about everything. Also, it'll be funny. Intelligence is just memes at scale.

**Zuck**: *[sweating in his BBQ shirt]* Meta's investing $250 million per researcher because we believe in the mission—

**Lip-Bu**: *[grimly professional]* Intel is... restructuring our AI strategy. We're focusing on... sustainable innovation.

**The Engineer**: You mean you're desperately trying to stay relevant after burning $30 billion on virtual legs, Zuck?

**Dimitri**: In Moscow, we joke that American tech is like Roman concrete—you've forgotten why it works, you just know it costs money.

## II. The Architecture of Diminishing Returns

**Sam**: The scaling laws are clear. More compute equals more intelligence—

**The Engineer**: More compute equals more convincing pattern matching. That's not intelligence, that's brute force. Like saying a bigger calculator understands mathematics.

**Wei**: This is why China focused on efficiency. You throw trillion parameters at problems. We ask: why does it take a trillion parameters to count the R's in "strawberry"?

**Dario**: *[adjusting his glasses]* At Anthropic, we're taking a safety-first approach—

**The Engineer**: While still burning $2 billion to keep Claude running? How safe is bankruptcy?

**Dimitri**: Americans always think bigger means better. Romans thought the same about their circuses.

## III. The GPU Gold Rush of Late-Stage Capitalism

**Jensen**: *[literally counting money]* Our market cap exceeds Intel, AMD, and most countries' GDP. Why? Because everyone needs our shovels for their gold rush.

**Lip-Bu**: *[diplomatic but tired]* Intel invented the microprocessor. We created this industry—

**Jensen**: And we're ending it. Beautifully. While you were optimizing 5% improvements, we were selling dreams at 10,000% markup.

**Lip-Bu**: *[under breath]* I inherited this mess three months ago...

**Trump**: I'm putting a tariff on Chinese AI. Huge tariff. The biggest tariff. America First AI!

**Jack Ma**: *[shaking head]* But your AI runs on chips made in Taiwan, assembled in China, using rare earths from—

**Trump**: AMERICA FIRST!

**Zuck**: The market understands the opportunity. Our stock is up because—

**The Engineer**: Because investors see the same thing they saw in crypto, in the metaverse. The next greater fool. "It was beautiful and nothing worked."

**Elon**: *[still tweeting]* FSD next year. AGI next year. Mars next year. The key is to promise everything and deliver memes.

**Sam**: This is different. AGI will solve climate change, cure cancer—

**Wei**: Your GPUs alone consume more power than small nations. You're accelerating climate change to pretend to solve it.

**Dimitri**: *[laughing]* In Russia, we have a saying: "The future is certain; it's the past that keeps changing." You keep promising AGI next year, like Tesla promising Full Self Driving.

**Elon**: *[triggered]* FSD is feature complete! It just needs... refinement. For another decade.

## IV. The Great Brain Drain

**Wei**: You know what's funny? Half my team at Qwen has PhDs from American universities. You trained us, then act surprised when we build our own models.

**Dimitri**: Same in Moscow. Stanford, MIT, Berkeley—they educated our best minds. Now those minds are building sovereign AI while you debate pronouns in code comments.

**Sam**: But OpenAI is leading—

**Wei**: Leading in what? Burning money? We're achieving 90% of your performance at 10% of the cost. That's not leading, that's waste.

**The Engineer**: Rome sent its gold to barbarian mercenaries too. Worked out great for them.

## V. On Frameworks and Forgotten Knowledge

**Zuck**: Our open source contributions democratize AI—

**The Engineer**: You mean frameworks like Active Agent? Abstractions on abstractions so Rails developers can pretend they're AI engineers?

**Dimitri**: It's beautiful, really. You've created tools to help people who can't code use tools built by people who can't code to generate code that doesn't work.

**Wei**: In Shenzhen, we still teach actual computer science. Here, you teach prompt engineering. Who do you think will maintain the infrastructure when the API credits run out?

**Dario**: The abstraction layers make AI accessible—

**The Engineer**: They make incompetence accessible. Watch a modern developer try to implement quicksort without ChatGPT. They can't. You've replaced understanding with API calls.

## VI. The Token Economy

**Sam**: The token economy is a sustainable business model—

**The Engineer**: It's charging by the word for what used to be free—thinking. You've financialized cognition itself.

**Wei**: And who controls the tokens? American companies. It's digital colonialism with extra steps.

**Dimitri**: *[smirking]* At least with oil, you get heat. With tokens, you get... generated text that might be hallucinated?

**Zuck**: The market will optimize—

**The Engineer**: The market is a Ponzi scheme. VCs fund companies that burn tokens that require GPUs that need more funding from VCs who expect returns from... the next funding round.

## VII. The Quiet Part Spoken Aloud

**Dario**: *[uncomfortable]* Look, we all know the current approach has limitations—

**Jensen**: *[interrupting]* Limitations that require more GPUs to overcome! B100s coming soon, only $80,000 each.

**Lip-Bu**: *[reading prepared statement]* Intel's roadmap remains... viable. We're committed to... shareholder value.

**The Engineer**: You all know transformers aren't the path to AGI. You know the economics don't work. But the music's playing and the checks are clearing.

**Trump**: *[not listening]* When I'm president again, we'll have the best AI. China will pay for our compute. It'll be beautiful—

**Jack Ma**: Nothing you build works. Your Twitter is broken. Your Facebook spies. Your Tesla crashes. But it's all beautiful?

**The Engineer**: "It was beautiful and nothing worked." The Silicon Valley Story.

**Sam**: *[defensively]* We're iterating toward—

**Wei**: Toward what? You've hit the same wall we have. The difference is we admit it's a wall. You call it a "temporary scaling challenge."

**Elon**: *[philosophically, while high]* What if the wall IS the intelligence? What if consciousness is just... walls all the way down?

**Dimitri**: This is why Russia and China are building domestic capabilities. When your bubble bursts—and bubbles always burst—we'll still have functional systems.

**The Engineer**: Built on knowledge you learned at our universities.

**Wei**: *[shrugging]* You sold us the education. Don't complain when we use it.

## VIII. The Geopolitical Reality Check

**Zuck**: AGI will transform geopolitics—

**Dimitri**: Your country can't even fix its power grid. But sure, AGI will solve everything.

**Wei**: San Francisco has medieval diseases returning while you spend billions on chatbots. Beijing has high-speed rail. Who's really winning the future?

**The Engineer**: We're building AI agents while human agents can't afford rent. Optimizing transformers while democracy's transformers—I mean, infrastructure—crumbles.

**Sam**: Once we achieve AGI—

**Everyone**: *[in unison]* NEXT YEAR.

**Sam**: *[frustrated]* This time is different!

**The Engineer**: That's what they said about neural networks in 2003. About deep learning in 2012. About crypto in 2017. About the metaverse—

**Zuck**: *[interrupting]* The metaverse is still—

**Everyone**: *[laughing]*

## IX. What Remains When the Music Stops

**Wei**: When your bubble bursts, what happens to global AI development?

**The Engineer**: The same thing that happened after every bubble. Real engineers pick up the pieces and build something useful. Without the hype.

**Dimitri**: Except this time, the real engineers are in Beijing and Moscow.

**Dario**: That's... concerning for American interests—

**The Engineer**: Should've thought about that before you replaced your entire junior developer pipeline with Copilot.

**Sam**: We're not replacing—

**The Engineer**: Name one junior developer you've hired who can code without AI assistance. One.

**[Silence]**

## X. The Concrete We're Not Making

**Wei**: Roman concrete lasted two thousand years. Your software breaks if someone sneezes near the dependencies.

**Dimitri**: They built for eternity without understanding the chemistry. You understand the mathematics perfectly and build for the next quarterly earnings call.

**Zuck**: We're building the future—

**The Engineer**: You're cosplaying the future while the present collapses. It's Nero fiddling, but the fiddle is a keyboard and the song is "AGI will save us."

**Sam**: So what's your solution?

**The Engineer**: Stop pretending pattern matching is intelligence. Stop selling AGI promises to fund brute force scaling. Solve actual problems with actual engineering.

**Wei**: Or don't. We'll be happy to pick up your market share.

**Dimitri**: And your talent. They're already sending resumes.

## Epilogue: "So It Goes"

**Jensen**: *[standing to leave]* I need to go count money. The B100 launch is next week. $80,000 per unit, limited supply.

**Lip-Bu**: *[resignedly]* Intel will continue to... evaluate strategic options. *[to himself]* Why did I take this job?

**Trump**: *[to no one in particular]* I'll make AGI great. The greatest AGI. Nobody's ever seen AGI like I'll make.

**Dario**: *[checking phone]* Board meeting about our next funding round—

**Sam**: *[also leaving]* Same. Investors to promise AGI to.

**Elon**: *[still tweeting]* Next year. Everything next year. FSD, AGI, Mars, brain chips. The future is always next year.

**Jack Ma**: *[to The Engineer]* In my retirement, I teach. You know what I tell students? "Computer is tool. Human is human." They don't listen. They want to build tools that replace humans.

**Zuck**: *[standing]* The metaverse integration with AI is going to—

**Everyone**: *[already walking away]*

**The Engineer**: *[to Wei and Dimitri]* "It was beautiful and nothing worked." That'll be our epitaph.

**Wei**: In China, we have a saying: "When the tide goes out, you see who's been swimming naked."

**Dimitri**: In Russia, we say: "Then what?"

**Jack Ma**: In business, we say: "When everyone's buying shovels, sell maps to nowhere."

**Jensen**: *[overhearing]* I prefer selling the shovels.

**The Engineer**: Then we remember how to actually solve problems. Or you do, while we generate solutions that look right but aren't.

**Trump**: *[still talking to himself]* The best AGI. Tremendous. You've never seen intelligence like this artificial intelligence...

*[They disperse into the Mar-a-Lago twilight. Outside, the Teslas still can't self-drive, the homeless camps grow, democracy wheezes its last breaths. Inside, men who've never written a line of code decide the future of intelligence. So it goes.]*

## Author's Note

This dialogue was typed without AI assistance, because I still can. The typos are mine, the cynicism is earned, the skepticism is justified.

Kurt Vonnegut wrote about Dresden: "Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt." He was describing death. Silicon Valley's version: "Everything was beautiful and nothing worked." They're describing the future.

We trained the world's brightest minds at Stanford and MIT, then acted surprised when they went home to build Qwen and ERNIE and Kandinsky. We replaced our developers with pattern matchers, then wondered why nothing works. We're propping up a failing economy with GPU purchases and API calls while Jensen Huang becomes richer than most nations.

Lip-Bu Tan inherited Intel's corpse and is expected to resurrect it. Elon promises FSD next year, every year. Trump promises to tariff mathematics itself. Jack Ma is the only honest one—he never pretended computers could think. Sam Altman keeps promising AGI while burning $700,000 daily. Zuck pivots from fake legs to fake intelligence. And The Engineer remembers when code actually solved problems instead of generating more code to generate more problems.

The Romans at least knew they were debasing their currency. We call it "investing in the future."

The Romans built coliseums for bread and circuses. We built data centers for tokens and demos.

The Romans' concrete lasted 2000 years. Our software breaks when someone updates a dependency.

So it goes.

That, or the fall of the Roman Empire. But with better marketing and worse outcomes.

*The barbarians aren't at the gates. They're on the cap table, selling shovels to grave diggers who think they're planting seeds.*

"It was beautiful and nothing worked."
