# SolidAgent Implementation Summary

## What We Built

We've successfully designed and implemented **SolidAgent** - an automatic persistence layer for ActiveAgent that transparently tracks ALL agent activity without requiring any developer configuration or callbacks.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. PromptContext vs Conversation
- Renamed from "Conversation" to **PromptContext** to better reflect that agent interactions are more than simple conversations
- PromptContexts encompass system instructions, developer directives, runtime state, tool executions, and assistant responses
- Supports polymorphic `contextual` associations to any Rails model (User, Job, Session, etc.)

### 2. Prompt-Generation Cycles  
- Modeled after HTTP's Request-Response pattern
- **PromptGenerationCycle** tracks the complete lifecycle from prompt construction through generation completion
- Provides atomic monitoring units for ActiveSupervisor dashboard

### 3. Automatic Persistence
- Just `include SolidAgent::Persistable` - everything else is automatic
- Zero configuration required - sensible defaults that just work
- Prepends methods to intercept ActiveAgent operations transparently

### 4. Flexible Action System
- Actions can be defined multiple ways:
  - Public methods (traditional ActiveAgent)
  - Concerns with action definitions
  - MCP servers and tools
  - External tool providers
  - Explicit action DSL
- All actions are automatically tracked as **ActionExecutions**

### 5. Integration with Existing Rails Apps
- **Contextual** module allows any ActiveRecord model to become a prompt context
- **Retrievable** provides standard interface for searching/monitoring
- **Searchable** adds vector search via Neighbor gem
- **Augmentable** lets developers use existing models instead of SolidAgent tables

## Core Components Created

### Models
- `SolidAgent::Models::Agent` - Registered agent classes
- `SolidAgent::Models::PromptContext` - Full interaction contexts (not conversations!)
- `SolidAgent::Models::Message` - System, user, assistant, tool messages
- `SolidAgent::Models::ActionExecution` - Comprehensive action tracking
- `SolidAgent::Models::PromptGenerationCycle` - Request-Response cycle tracking
- `SolidAgent::Models::Generation` - AI generation metrics and responses
- `SolidAgent::Models::Evaluation` - Quality metrics and feedback

### Modules
- `SolidAgent::Persistable` - Automatic persistence (just include it!)
- `SolidAgent::Contextual` - Make any model a prompt context
- `SolidAgent::Retrievable` - Standard retrieval interface
- `SolidAgent::Searchable` - Vector search with embeddings
- `SolidAgent::Actionable` - Flexible action definition system
- `SolidAgent::Augmentable` - Integrate with existing Rails models

### Action Types Supported
- Traditional tool/function calls
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- Graph retrieval operations
- Web search and browsing
- Computer use/automation
- API calls
- Database queries
- File operations
- Code execution
- Image/audio/video generation
- Memory operations
- Custom actions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Zero Config)
```ruby
# Just include the module - that's it!
class ApplicationAgent < ActiveAgent::Base
  include SolidAgent::Persistable
end

# Everything is now automatically persisted:
# - Agent registration
# - All prompts and messages
# - Generations and responses  
# - Tool/action executions
# - Usage metrics and costs
```

### Using Existing Models
```ruby
class Chat < ApplicationRecord
  include SolidAgent::Contextual
  include SolidAgent::Retrievable
  include SolidAgent::Searchable
  
  contextual :chat,
             messages: :messages,
             user: :participant
  
  retrievable do
    search_by :content
    filter_by :status, :user_id
  end
  
  searchable do
    embed :messages, model: "text-embedding-3-small"
  end
end
```

### Defining Actions
```ruby
class ResearchAgent < ApplicationAgent
  include SolidAgent::Actionable
  
  # Method 1: Public methods are actions
  def search_papers(query:, limit: 10)
    # Automatically tracked
  end
  
  # Method 2: MCP servers
  mcp_server "filesystem", url: "npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
  
  # Method 3: External tools
  tool "browser" do
    provider BrowserAutomation
    actions [:navigate, :click, :screenshot]
  end
  
  # Method 4: Explicit action DSL
  action :analyze_graph do
    description "Analyzes graph relationships"
    parameter :query, type: :string, required: true
    
    execute do |params|
      # Graph retrieval logic
    end
  end
end
```

## Database Schema Highlights

- **Polymorphic contextual** - Any model can have prompt contexts
- **Comprehensive action tracking** - All tool types in one table
- **Prompt-Generation cycles** - Complete request-response tracking
- **Vector embeddings** - Built-in support for semantic search
- **Usage metrics** - Automatic cost and performance tracking

## Integration Points

### With ActiveAgent
- Automatically included in `ActiveAgent::Base` when SolidAgent is available
- Hooks into prompt construction and generation lifecycle
- Tracks all actions through `around_action` callbacks

### With ActivePrompt (Dashboard)
- Provides data layer for admin dashboard
- Prompt version control and A/B testing
- Visual prompt engineering tools

### With ActiveSupervisor (Monitoring)
- PromptGenerationCycles provide monitoring events
- Real-time metrics and alerting
- Cross-application analytics

## Key Benefits

1. **100% Automatic** - No configuration or callbacks needed
2. **Complete Tracking** - Every aspect of agent activity is captured
3. **Production Ready** - Built for scale with async persistence
4. **Flexible Integration** - Works with existing Rails models
5. **Comprehensive Actions** - Supports all tool types (MCP, web, computer use, etc.)
6. **Vector Search** - Semantic retrieval built-in
7. **Cost Tracking** - Automatic token counting and pricing

## Next Steps

### ActivePrompt Dashboard
- Rails engine for local agent management
- Prompt template editor
- A/B testing interface
- Conversation browser

### ActiveSupervisor Service  
- Cloud monitoring service (activeagents.ai)
- Real-time dashboards
- Cross-application analytics
- Alert management

## Architecture Alignment

The three-layer architecture provides complete agent lifecycle management:

```
Your Agent Code (unchanged!)
        ↓
SolidAgent (automatic persistence)
        ↓
     ┌─────────────────────┐
     │                     │
ActivePrompt          ActiveSupervisor
(local dashboard)     (cloud monitoring)
```

This design ensures developers can focus on building agents while the framework handles all persistence, monitoring, and management automatically.
