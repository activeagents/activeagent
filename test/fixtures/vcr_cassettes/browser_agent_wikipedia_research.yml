        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content
