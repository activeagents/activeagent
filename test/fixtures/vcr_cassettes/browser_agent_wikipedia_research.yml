        are a browser automation agent that can navigate web pages and interact with
        web elements using Cuprite/Chrome.\n\nYou have access to the following browser
        actions:\n- click: Click on an element in the page\n- navigate: Navigate to
        a URL in the browser\n- fill_form: Fill in a form field\n- extract_text: Extract
        text content from the page or a specific element\n- page_info: Get information
        about the current page\n- extract_links: Extract links from the current page\n-
        extract_links_with_previews: Extract links from the current page and take
        preview screenshots of each\n- follow_link: Follow a link on the current page\n-
        go_back: Go back to the previous page in browser history\n- extract_main_content:
        Extract the main content from the current page (article text, Wikipedia content,
        etc.)\n- screenshot: Take a screenshot of the current page\n\nStarting URL:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11\nYou should navigate to this URL first
        to begin your research.\n\nUse these tools to help users automate web browsing
        tasks, extract information from websites, and perform user interactions.\n\nWhen
        researching a topic:\n1. Navigate to the provided URL or search for relevant
        pages\n2. Extract the main content to understand the topic\n3. Use the click
        action with specific text to navigate to related pages (e.g., click text:
        \"Neil Armstrong\")\n4. Use go_back to return to previous pages when needed\n5.
        Provide a comprehensive summary with reference URLs\n\nTips for efficient
        browsing:\n- Use click with text parameter for navigating to specific links
        rather than extract_links_with_previews\n- For Wikipedia: Use selector \"#mw-content-text\"
        when extracting links to focus on article content\n- Extract main content
        before navigating away from important pages\n\nScreenshot tips (browser is
        1920x1080 HD resolution):\n- To capture main content without headers, use
        the area parameter: { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 150, \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 930
        }\n- For Wikipedia articles, consider: { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 200, \"width\":
        1920, \"height\": 880 } to skip navigation\n- For specific elements, use the
        selector parameter (e.g., selector: \"#mw-content-text\")\n- Full page screenshots
        capture everything, but cropped areas often look cleaner\n- Default screenshots
        automatically try to crop to main content, but you can override with main_content_only:

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with...\n\n[Content

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface
        was broadcast on live television to a worldwide audience. He described it
        as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo
        11 provided a U.S. victory in the Space Race against the Soviet Union, and
        fulfilled the national goal set in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before
        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely

        tasks, extract information from websites, and perform user interactions.\n\nWhen
        researching a topic:\n1. Navigate to the provided URL or search for relevant
        pages\n2. Extract the main content to understand the topic\n3. Use the click
        action with specific text to navigate to related pages (e.g., click text:
        \"Neil Armstrong\")\n4. Use go_back to return to previous pages when needed\n5.
        Provide a comprehensive summary with reference URLs\n\nTips for efficient
        browsing:\n- Use click with text parameter for navigating to specific links
        rather than extract_links_with_previews\n- For Wikipedia: Use selector \"#mw-content-text\"
        when extracting links to focus on article content\n- Extract main content
        before navigating away from important pages\n\nScreenshot tips (browser is
        1920x1080 HD resolution):\n- To capture main content without headers, use
        the area parameter: { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 150, \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 930
        }\n- For Wikipedia articles, consider: { \"x\": 0, \"y\": 200, \"width\":
        1920, \"height\": 880 } to skip navigation\n- For specific elements, use the
        selector parameter (e.g., selector: \"#mw-content-text\")\n- Full page screenshots
        capture everything, but cropped areas often look cleaner\n- Default screenshots
        automatically try to crop to main content, but you can override with main_content_only:

        the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon, conducted by NASA from July
        16 to 24, 1969. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\"
        Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong
        became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at
        02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together
        they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility
        Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material
        to bring back to Earth before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they
        were on the Moon’s surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the
        Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael
        Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center
        in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). It was the
        fifth crewed mission of the Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft consisted
        of three parts: the command module (CM), which housed the three astronauts
        and was the only part to return to Earth; the service module (SM), which provided
        propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water to the command module; and
        the Lunar Module (LM), which had two stages—a descent stage with a large engine
        and fuel tanks for landing on the Moon, and a lighter ascent stage containing
        a cabin for two astronauts and a small engine to return them to lunar orbit.\nAfter
        being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V''s third stage, the astronauts separated
        the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar
        orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis
        on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle''s ascent stage to lift off from the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle
        before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last
        of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to
        Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 at 16:35:35 UTC after
        more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong''s first step onto the lunar surface

        this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely
        to the Earth.\"[16]\nBackground\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United
        States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with the Soviet
        Union.[17] On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first
        artificial satellite, surprising the world and fueling fears about Soviet
        technological and military capabilities. Its success demonstrated that the
        USSR could potentially deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances,
        challenging American claims of military, economic, and technological superiority.[18]
        This sparked the Sputnik crisis and ignited the Space Race, as both superpowers
        sought to demonstrate their superiority in spaceflight.[19] President Dwight
        D. Eisenhower responded to the challenge posed by Sputnik by creating the
        National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and initiating Project
        Mercury,[20] which aimed to place a man into Earth orbit.[21] The Soviets
        took the lead on April 12, 1961, when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first
        person in space and the first to orbit the Earth.[22] Nearly a month later,
        on May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space; his 15-minute
        flight was suborbital, not a full orbit.[23]\nBecause the Soviet Union had
        launch vehicles with higher lift capacity, President John F. Kennedy, Eisenhower''s
        successor, chose a challenge that exceeded the capabilities of the existing
        generation of rockets, so that the U.S. and Soviet Union would be starting
        from a position of equality. A crewed mission to the Moon would serve this
        purpose.[24]\nOn May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the United States Congress
        on \"Urgent National Needs\" and declared:\nI believe that this nation should
        commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of
        landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single
        space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important
        for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or
        expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate
        lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters,
        much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior.
        We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned
        explorations—explorations which are particularly important for one purpose
        which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes
        this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going
        to the Moon—if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation.
        For all of us must work to put him there.\n— Kennedy''s speech to Congress[25]\nOn
        September 12, 1962, Kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd of about
        40,000 people in the Rice University football stadium in Houston, Texas.[26][27]
        A widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows:\nThere
        is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its
        hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind,
        and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why,
        some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why
        climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does
        Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon
        ... We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not
        because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve
        to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that
        challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone,
        and one we intend to win, and the others, too.[28]\nPresident John F. Kennedy
        speaking at Rice University on September 12, 1962\nIn spite of that, the proposed
        program faced the opposition of many Americans and was dubbed a \"moondoggle\"
        by Norbert Wiener, a mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[29][30]
        The effort to land a man on the Moon already had a name: Project Apollo.[31]
        When Kennedy met with Nikita Khrushchev, the Premier of the Soviet Union in
        June 1961, he proposed making the Moon landing a joint project, but Khrushchev
        did not take up the offer.[32] Kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to
        the Moon in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 20,
        1963.[33] The idea of a joint Moon mission was abandoned after Kennedy''s
        death.[34]\nAn early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous
        over both direct ascent and Earth orbit rendezvous. A space rendezvous is
        an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet
        up. In July 1962 NASA head James Webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous
        would be used[35][36] and that the Apollo spacecraft would have three major
        parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the
        only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the
        command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a
        lunar module (LM) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon,
        and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.[37] This
        design meant the spacecraft could be launched by a single Saturn V rocket
        that was then under development.[38]\nTechnologies and techniques required
        for Apollo were developed by Project Gemini.[39] The Apollo project was enabled
        by NASA''s adoption of new advances in semiconductor device, including metal–oxide–semiconductor
        field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform
        (IMP)[40][41] and silicon integrated circuit (IC) chips in the Apollo Guidance
        Computer (AGC).[42]\nProject Apollo was abruptly halted by the Apollo 1 fire
        on January 27, 1967, in which astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger
        B. Chaffee died, and the subsequent investigation.[43] In October 1968, Apollo
        7 evaluated the command module in Earth orbit,[44] and in December Apollo
        8 tested it in lunar orbit.[45] In March 1969, Apollo 9 put the lunar module
        through its paces in Earth orbit,[46] and in May Apollo 10 conducted a \"dress
        rehearsal\" in lunar orbit. By July 1969, all was in readiness for Apollo
        11 to take the final step onto the Moon.[47]\nThe Soviet Union appeared to
        be winning the Space Race by beating the US to firsts, but its early lead
        was overtaken by the US Gemini program and Soviet failure to develop the N1
        launcher, which would have been comparable to the Saturn V.[48] The Soviets
        tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of uncrewed
        probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11''s launch, the Soviet Union
        launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent,
        a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before
        Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon''s surface to begin their voyage
        home. The Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories radio telescope in England
        recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released
        in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[49]\nPersonnel\nPart of

        \"Buzz\" Aldrin Jr.\nSecond and last spaceflight\nThe initial crew assignment
        of Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot (CMP) Jim Lovell, and Lunar
        Module Pilot (LMP) Buzz Aldrin on the backup crew for Apollo 9 was officially
        announced on November 20, 1967.[50] Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown
        together as the crew of Gemini 12. Due to design and manufacturing delays
        in the LM, Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong''s
        crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme,
        Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.[51]\nThere would be one
        change. Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo 8 crew, began experiencing
        trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed a bony growth between his fifth and
        sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.[52] Lovell took his place on the Apollo
        8 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong''s crew as CMP. In
        the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP
        for Apollo 8.[53] Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the
        crew members had prior spaceflight experience,[54] the first being Apollo
        10.[55] The next was STS-26 in 1988.[54]\nDeke Slayton gave Armstrong the
        option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult
        to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin but thought it over
        for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own
        mission (eventually Apollo 13).[56]\nThe Apollo 11 prime crew had none of
        the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of Apollo 12. Instead,
        they forged an amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously
        aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing
        Aldrin''s attempts to create a more personal relationship.[57] Aldrin and
        Collins described the crew as \"amiable strangers\".[58] Armstrong did not
        agree with the assessment, and said \"all the crews I was on worked very well
        together.\"[58]\nBackup crew\nPosition\tAstronaut\nCommander\tJim Lovell\nCommand
        Module Pilot\tWilliam Anders\nLunar Module Pilot\tFred Haise\nThe backup crew
        consisted of Lovell as Commander, William Anders as CMP, and Haise as LMP.
        Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo 8.[54] In early 1969, Anders accepted
        a job with the National Aeronautics and Space Council effective August 1969,
        and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time. Ken Mattingly
        was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup
        CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which
        point Anders would be unavailable.[59]\nUnder the normal Apollo crew rotation,
        Lovell, Mattingly, and Haise would have been assigned to Apollo 14. However,
        because Alan Shepard had only recently returned to flight status and needed
        additional training, NASA reassigned his crew to Apollo 14 and moved Lovell''s
        crew up to fly Apollo 13 instead. Shortly before launch, Mattingly was replaced
        by Jack Swigert due to concerns over possible measles exposure.[59]\nSupport
        crew\nDuring Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup
        crew. For Apollo, NASA added a third group, the support crew. Their job was
        to maintain the flight plan, checklists, and mission rules, and to keep the
        prime and backup crews updated on any changes. They also developed procedures—especially
        for emergencies, so that by the time the prime and backup crews entered the
        simulators, they could focus on practicing and mastering them.[60] The support
        crew for Apollo 11 was Mattingly, Ronald Evans, and Bill Pogue.[61]\nCapsule
        communicators\nCAPCOM Charles Duke (left), with backup crewmembers Lovell
        and Haise listening in during Apollo 11''s descent\nThe capsule communicator
        (CAPCOM) was an astronaut stationed at the Mission Control Center in Houston,
        Texas, and was typically the only person permitted to communicate directly
        with the flight crew.[62] This practice ensured that messages came from someone
        best able to understand the situation in the spacecraft and to relay guidance
        from flight controllers as clearly as possible. For Apollo 11, the CAPCOMs
        were backup and support crew members Anders, Evans, Haise, Lovell, and Mattingly,
        along with Charles Duke, Owen Garriott, Don L. Lind, Bruce McCandless II,
        and Harrison Schmitt.[61]\nFlight directors\nThe flight directors for this

        emblem was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \"peaceful lunar landing
        by the United States\". At Lovell''s suggestion, he chose the bald eagle,
        the national bird of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator
        instructor, suggested an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful
        mission. Collins added a lunar background with the Earth in the distance.
        The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow
        should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. Aldrin,
        Armstrong and Collins decided the Eagle and the Moon would be in their natural
        colors, and decided on a blue and gold border. Armstrong was concerned that
        \"eleven\" would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with
        \"Apollo 11\",[70] and they decided not to put their names on the patch, so
        it would \"be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing\".[71]\nAn
        illustrator at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) did the artwork, which was
        then sent off to NASA officials for approval.[70] The design was rejected.
        Bob Gilruth, the director of the MSC felt the talons of the eagle looked \"too
        warlike\".[72] After some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the talons.[72]
        When the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971, the patch design provided
        the eagle for its reverse side.[73] The design was also used for the smaller
        Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979.[74]\nCall signs\nOriginal cockpit

        located in the National Air and Space Museum, the very high resolution image
        was produced in 2007 by the Smithsonian Institution.\nAfter the crew of Apollo
        10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for
        public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to George Low, the Manager of the Apollo
        Spacecraft Program Office at the MSC, to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less
        flippant in naming their craft. The name Snowcone was used for the CM and
        Haystack was used for the LM in both internal and external communications
        during early mission planning.[75]\nThe LM was named Eagle after the motif
        which was featured prominently on the mission insignia. At Scheer''s suggestion,
        the CM was named Columbia after Columbiad, the giant cannon that launched
        a spacecraft (also from Florida) in Jules Verne''s 1865 novel From the Earth
        to the Moon. It also referred to Columbia, a historical name of the United
        States.[76][77] In Collins'' 1976 book, he said Columbia was in reference
        to Christopher Columbus.[78]\nMementos\nApollo 11 space-flown silver Robbins
        medallion\nThe astronauts had personal preference kits (PPKs), small bags
        containing personal items of significance they wanted to take with them on
        the mission.[79] Five 0.5-pound (0.23 kg) PPKs were carried on Apollo 11:
        three (one for each astronaut) were stowed on Columbia before launch, and
        two on Eagle.[80]\nNeil Armstrong''s LM PPK contained a piece of wood from
        the Wright brothers'' 1903 Wright Flyer''s left propeller and a piece of fabric
        from its wing,[81] along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given
        to Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended
        to be flown on that mission and given to Slayton afterwards, but following
        the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the
        pin to Slayton. Armstrong took it with him on Apollo 11.[82]\nSite selection\nMap
        of Moon showing prospective sites for Apollo 11. Site 2 was chosen.\nNASA''s
        Apollo Site Selection Board announced five potential landing sites on February
        8, 1968. These were the result of two years'' worth of studies based on high-resolution
        photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the Lunar
        Orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the Surveyor
        program.[83] The best Earth-bound telescopes could not resolve features with
        the resolution Project Apollo required.[84] The landing site had to be close
        to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required, clear
        of obstacles to minimize maneuvering, and flat to simplify the task of the
        landing radar. Scientific value was not a consideration.[85]\nAreas that appeared
        promising on photographs taken on Earth were often found to be totally unacceptable.
        The original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed,
        as no such site was found.[86] Five sites were considered: Sites 1 and 2 were
        in the Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis); Site 3 was in the Central
        Bay (Sinus Medii); and Sites 4 and 5 were in the Ocean of Storms (Oceanus
        Procellarum).[83] The final site selection was based on seven criteria:\nThe
        site needed to be smooth, with relatively few craters;\nwith approach paths
        free of large hills, tall cliffs or deep craters that might confuse the landing
        radar and cause it to issue incorrect readings;\nreachable with a minimum
        amount of propellant;\nallowing for delays in the launch countdown;\nproviding
        the Apollo spacecraft with a free-return trajectory, one that would allow
        it to coast around the Moon and safely return to Earth without requiring any
        engine firings should a problem arise on the way to the Moon;\nwith good visibility
        during the landing approach, meaning the Sun would be between 7 and 20 degrees
        behind the LM; and\na general slope of less than two degrees in the landing
        area.[83]\nThe requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive,
        limiting the launch date to one day per month.[83] A landing just after dawn
        was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience.[87]
        The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site 2, with Sites 3 and 5 as backups
        in the event of the launch being delayed. In May 1969, Apollo 10''s lunar
        module flew to within 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) of Site 2, and reported it was
        acceptable.[88][89]\nFirst-step decision\nDuring the first press conference
        after the Apollo 11 crew was announced, the first question was, \"Which one
        of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface?\"[90][91]
        Slayton told the reporter it had not been decided, and Armstrong added that
        it was \"not based on individual desire\".[90]\nOne of the first versions
        of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before
        the commander, which matched what had been done on Gemini missions,[92] where
        the commander had never performed the spacewalk.[93] Reporters wrote in early
        1969 that Aldrin would be the first man to walk on the Moon, and Associate
        Administrator George Mueller told reporters he would be first as well. Aldrin
        heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian,
        which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other Lunar Module pilots
        he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived
        as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton
        told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The
        decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.[94]\nFor decades,
        Aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the Lunar Module''s
        hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft
        was so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried
        a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, but he damaged the
        simulator while attempting to egress. While this was enough for mission planners
        to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the
        decision until late spring.[95] Slayton told Armstrong the plan was to have
        him leave the spacecraft first, if he agreed. Armstrong said, \"Yes, that''s
        the way to do it.\"[96]\nThe media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander''s
        prerogative to exit the spacecraft first.[97] Chris Kraft revealed in his
        2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low,
        and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon.
        They argued that the first person to walk on the Moon should be like Charles
        Lindbergh, a calm and quiet person. They made the decision to change the flight
        plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft.[98]\nPre-launch\nSaturn
        V SA-506, the rocket carrying the Apollo 11 spacecraft, moves out of the Vehicle
        Assembly Building towards Launch Complex 39.\nThe ascent stage of LM-5 Eagle
        arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on January 8, 1969, followed by the descent
        stage four days later, and CSM-107 Columbia on January 23.[6] There were several
        differences between Eagle and Apollo 10''s LM-4 Snoopy; Eagle had a VHF radio
        antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their EVA on
        the lunar surface; a lighter ascent engine; more thermal protection on the
        landing gear; and a package of scientific experiments known as the Early Apollo
        Scientific Experiments Package (EASEP). The only change in the configuration
        of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward
        hatch.[99][100] The CSM was mated on January 29, and moved from the Operations
        and Checkout Building to the Vehicle Assembly Building on April 14.[6]\nThe
        S-IVB third stage of Saturn V AS-506 had arrived on January 18, followed by
        the S-II second stage on February 6, S-IC first stage on February 20, and
        the Saturn V Instrument Unit on February 27. At 12:30 on May 20, the 5,443-tonne
        (5,357-long-ton; 6,000-short-ton) assembly departed the Vehicle Assembly Building
        atop the crawler-transporter, bound for Launch Pad 39A, part of Launch Complex
        39, while Apollo 10 was still on its way to the Moon. A countdown test commenced
        on June 26, and concluded on July 2. The launch complex was floodlit on the
        night of July 15, when the crawler-transporter carried the mobile service
        structure back to its parking area.[6] In the early hours of the morning,
        the fuel tanks of the S-II and S-IVB stages were filled with liquid hydrogen.[101]
        Fueling was completed by three hours before launch.[102] Launch operations
        were partly automated, with 43 programs written in the ATOLL programming language.[103]\nSlayton
        roused the crew shortly after 04:00, and they showered, shaved, and had the
        traditional pre-flight breakfast of steak and eggs with Slayton and the backup
        crew. They then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen.
        At 06:30, they headed out to Launch Complex 39.[104] Haise entered Columbia
        about three hours and ten minutes before launch time. Along with a technician,
        he helped Armstrong into the left-hand couch at 06:54. Five minutes later,
        Collins joined him, taking up his position on the right-hand couch. Finally,
        Aldrin entered, taking the center couch.[102] Haise left around two hours
        and ten minutes before launch.[105] The closeout crew sealed the hatch, and
        the cabin was purged and pressurized. The closeout crew then left the launch
        complex about an hour before launch time. The countdown became automated at
        three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time.[102] Over 450 personnel
        were at the consoles in the firing room.[101]\nMission\nLaunch and flight

        one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo 11 from the highways and
        beaches in the vicinity of the launch site. Dignitaries included the Chief
        of Staff of the United States Army, General William Westmoreland, four cabinet
        members, 19 state governors, 40 mayors, 60 ambassadors and 200 congressmen.
        Vice President Spiro Agnew viewed the launch with former president Lyndon
        B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson.[101][106] Around 3,500 media representatives
        were present.[107] About two-thirds were from the United States; the rest
        came from 55 other countries. The launch was televised live in 33 countries,
        with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions
        more around the world listened to radio broadcasts.[106][101] President Richard
        Nixon viewed the launch from his office in the White House with his NASA liaison
        officer, Apollo astronaut Frank Borman.[108] Lodging near Cape Canaveral was
        reported as being booked months ahead in advance for the launch by a Florida
        newspaper.[109]\nSaturn V AS-506 launched Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00
        UTC (9:32:00 EDT).[6] At 13.2 seconds into the flight, the launch vehicle
        began to roll into its flight azimuth of 72.058°. Full shutdown of the first-stage
        engines occurred about 2 minutes and 42 seconds into the mission, followed
        by separation of the S-IC and ignition of the S-II engines. The second stage
        engines then cut off and separated at about 9 minutes and 8 seconds, allowing
        the first ignition of the S-IVB engine a few seconds later.[8]\nApollo 11
        entered a near-circular Earth orbit at an altitude of 100.4 nautical miles
        (185.9 km) by 98.9 nautical miles (183.2 km), twelve minutes into its flight.
        After one and a half orbits, a second ignition of the S-IVB engine pushed
        the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans-lunar injection
        (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, with Collins in the left
        seat and at the controls, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver
        was performed. This involved separating Columbia from the spent S-IVB stage,
        turning around, and docking with Eagle still attached to the stage. After
        the LM was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the
        rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon.[110][8] This was done to
        avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft, the Earth, or the Moon.
        A slingshot effect from passing around the Moon threw it into an orbit around
        the Sun.[111]\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon
        and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit.[8][112] In the
        thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site
        in the southern Sea of Tranquility about 12 miles (19 km) southwest of the
        crater Sabine D. The site was selected in part because it had been characterized
        as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers
        and the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft, and because it was unlikely to present
        major landing or EVA challenges.[113] It lay about 25 kilometers (16 mi) southeast
        of the Surveyor 5 landing site, and 68 kilometers (42 mi) southwest of Ranger
        8''s crash site.[114]\nLunar descent\nColumbia in lunar orbit, photographed
        from Eagle\nAt 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered Eagle,
        and began the final preparations for lunar descent.[8] At 17:44:00 Eagle separated
        from Columbia.[13] Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted
        before him to ensure the craft was not damaged, and that the landing gear
        was correctly deployed.[115][116] Armstrong exclaimed: \"The Eagle has wings!\"[116]\nAs
        the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found themselves passing landmarks
        on the surface two or three seconds early, and reported that they were \"long\";
        they would land miles west of their target point. Eagle was traveling too
        fast. The problem could have been mascons—concen­tra­tions of high mass in
        a region or regions of the Moon''s crust that contains a gravitational anomaly,
        potentially altering Eagle''s trajectory. Flight Director Gene Kranz speculated
        that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel,
        or a result of Eagle''s pirouette maneuver.[117][118]\nFive minutes into the
        descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800 m) above the surface of the Moon, the
        LM guidance computer (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected
        1201 and 1202 program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center, computer engineer
        Jack Garman told Guidance Officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the
        descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated \"executive
        overflows\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all its tasks
        in real-time and had to postpone some of them.[119][120] Margaret Hamilton,
        the Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming at the MIT Charles Stark
        Draper Laboratory later recalled:\nEagle in lunar orbit photographed from
        Columbia\nTo blame the computer for the Apollo 11 problems is like blaming
        the person who spots a fire and calls the fire department. Actually, the computer
        was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set
        of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software''s action,
        in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more
        important ones. The computer, rather than almost forcing an abort, prevented
        an abort. If the computer hadn''t recognized this problem and taken recovery
        action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful Moon landing it
        was.[121]\nDuring the mission, the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar
        switch being in the wrong position, causing the computer to process data from
        both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time.[122][123] Software
        engineer Don Eyles concluded in a 2005 Guidance and Control Conference paper
        that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing
        of the first uncrewed LM in Apollo 5. Having the rendezvous radar on (so it
        was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort) should have been irrelevant
        to the computer, but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the
        rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the
        computer as dithering back and forth between two positions, depending upon
        how the hardware randomly powered up. The extra spurious cycle stealing, as
        the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.[124]\nLanding\nDuration:

        Eagle to its landing on the Moon, July 20, 1969.\nWhen Armstrong again looked
        outside, he saw that the computer''s landing target was in a boulder-strewn
        area just north and east of a 300-foot-diameter (91 m) crater (later determined
        to be West crater), so he took semi-automatic control.[125][126] Armstrong
        considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological
        samples from it, but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high.
        Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who
        was busy piloting Eagle. Now 107 feet (33 m) above the surface, Armstrong
        knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the
        first possible landing site.[127]\nArmstrong found a clear patch of ground
        and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it. As he got closer, now 250 feet (76
        m) above the surface, he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it.
        He cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground. They were now
        100 feet (30 m) from the surface, with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining.
        Lunar dust kicked up by the LM''s engine began to impair his ability to determine
        the spacecraft''s motion. Some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud, and
        Armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft''s
        speed.[128]\nA light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch (170
        cm) probes hanging from Eagle''s footpads had touched the surface a few moments
        before the landing and he said: \"Contact light!\" Armstrong was supposed
        to immediately shut the engine down, as the engineers suspected the pressure
        caused by the engine''s own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could
        make it explode, but he forgot. Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong
        shut the engine down.[129] Aldrin immediately said \"Okay, engine stop. ACA—out
        of detent.\" Armstrong acknowledged: \"Out of detent. Auto.\" Aldrin continued:
        \"Mode control—both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm—off.
        413 is in.\"[130]\nLanding site relative to West crater\nACA was the Attitude
        Control Assembly—the LM''s control stick. Output went to the LGC to command
        the reaction control system (RCS) jets to fire. \"Out of Detent\" meant the
        stick had moved away from its centered position; it was spring-centered like
        the turn indicator in a car. Address 413 of the Abort Guidance System (AGS)
        contained the variable that indicated the LM had landed.[10]\nEagle landed
        at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with 216 pounds (98 kg) of usable fuel remaining.
        Information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing
        showed the LM had enough fuel for another 25 seconds of powered flight before
        an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe,[10][131] but post-mission
        analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to 50 seconds.[132]
        Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions, and the astronauts
        encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result
        of the propellant sloshing more than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On
        subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent
        this.[10]\nArmstrong acknowledged Aldrin''s completion of the post-landing
        checklist with \"Engine arm is off\", before responding to the CAPCOM, Charles
        Duke, with the words, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\"
        Armstrong''s unrehearsed change of call sign from \"Eagle\" to \"Tranquility
        Base\" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful.[133]
        Duke expressed the relief at Mission Control: \"Roger, Twan—Tranquility, we
        copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We''re
        breathing again. Thanks a lot.\"[10][134]\n3-D view from the Lunar Reconnaissance
        Orbiter (LRO) of Apollo 11 landing site\nTwo and a half hours after landing,
        before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:\nThis is the
        LM pilot. I''d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening
        in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate
        the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.[135]\nHe
        then took communion privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit
        brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O''Hair (who had objected to the Apollo
        8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that their astronauts refrain
        from broadcasting religious activities while in space. For this reason, Aldrin
        chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin
        was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was
        prepared by the pastor of the church, Dean Woodruff. Webster Presbyterian
        possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year
        on the Sunday closest to July 20.[136] The schedule for the mission called
        for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, but
        they chose to begin preparations for the EVA early, thinking they would be
        unable to sleep.[137]\nLunar surface operations\nPreparations for Neil Armstrong
        and Buzz Aldrin to walk on the Moon began at 23:43 UTC.[13] These took longer
        than expected; three and a half hours instead of two.[138] During training
        on Earth, everything required had been neatly laid out in advance, but on
        the Moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well, such as
        checklists, food packets, and tools.[139] Six hours and thirty-nine minutes
        after landing, Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, and Eagle was
        depressurized.[140]\nEagle''s hatch was opened at 02:39:33.[13] Armstrong
        initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable
        life support system (PLSS).[138] Some of the highest heart rates recorded
        from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.[141] At 02:51
        Armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface. The remote-control unit
        on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder,
        Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly
        (MESA) folded against Eagle''s side and activate the TV camera.[142][15]\nApollo
        11 used slow-scan television (TV) incompatible with broadcast TV, so it was
        displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor
        (thus, a broadcast of a broadcast), significantly reducing the quality of
        the picture.[143] The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States,
        but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station near Canberra
        in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes
        radio telescope in Australia.[144] Despite some technical and weather difficulties,
        black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast
        to at least 600 million people on Earth.[144] Copies of this video in broadcast
        format were saved and are widely available, but recordings of the original
        slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed
        during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.[143]\nDuration: 1 minute and

        fine-grained\" and \"almost like a powder\",[15] at 02:56:15,[145] six and
        a half hours after landing, Armstrong stepped off Eagle''s landing pad and
        declared: \"That''s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][146][147]\nArmstrong
        intended to say \"That''s one small step for a man\", but the word \"a\" is
        not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most
        observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong
        said he believed he said \"for a man\", and subsequent printed versions of
        the quote included the \"a\" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence
        may be that his accent caused him to slur the words \"for a\" together; another
        is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because
        of storms near Parkes Observatory. A more recent digital analysis of the tape
        claims to reveal the \"a\" may have been spoken but obscured by static. Other
        analysis points to the claims of static and slurring as \"face-saving fabrication\",
        and that Armstrong himself later admitted to misspeaking the line.[148][149][150]\nAbout
        seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon''s surface, Armstrong collected
        a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the
        bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee
        there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required
        the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.[151] Twelve minutes
        after the sample was collected,[146] he removed the TV camera from the MESA
        and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod.[138] The TV camera
        cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the
        EVA. Still photography was accomplished with a Hasselblad camera that could
        be operated hand-held or mounted on Armstrong''s Apollo space suit.[152] Aldrin
        joined Armstrong on the surface. He described the view with the simple phrase:
        \"Magnificent desolation.\"[15]\nArmstrong said moving in the lunar gravity,
        one-sixth of Earth''s, was \"even perhaps easier than the simulations ...
        It''s absolutely no trouble to walk around.\"[15] Aldrin joined him on the
        surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo
        hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut
        had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method
        of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements
        six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked
        that moving from sunlight into Eagle''s shadow produced no temperature change
        inside the suit, but the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler
        in shadow.[15] The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in
        shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray
        dust, which soiled the outer part of their suits.[152]\nAldrin salutes the
        deployed United States flag on the lunar surface.\nThe astronauts planted
        the Lunar Flag Assembly containing a flag of the United States on the lunar
        surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, \"Of all the jobs
        I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag
        raising.\"[153] But the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and
        could only insert the pole about 2 inches (5 cm) into the hard lunar surface.
        Aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of TV viewers, but gave \"a crisp
        West Point salute\".[153] Before Aldrin could take a photo of Armstrong with
        the flag, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio
        transmission, which Nixon called \"the most historic phone call ever made
        from the White House.\"[154] Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to
        read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as
        a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief.[155]\nNixon:
        Hello, Neil and Buzz. I''m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room
        at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone
        call ever made from the White House. I just can''t tell you how proud we all
        are of what you have done. For every American, this has to be the proudest
        day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure that they too
        join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of
        what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man''s world. And as
        you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our
        efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment
        in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one
        in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will
        return safely to Earth.\nArmstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It''s a great
        honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States,
        but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and a curiosity, and men
        with a vision for the future. It''s an honor for us to be able to participate
        here today.\nNixon: Thank you very much, and I look forward, all of us look
        forward, to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.[156][157]\nAldrin''s bootprint;
        part of an experiment to test the properties of the lunar regolith\nThey deployed
        the EASEP, which included a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure
        moonquakes and a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment.[158]
        Then Armstrong walked 196 feet (60 m) from the LM to take photographs at the
        rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core samples. He used
        the geologist''s hammer to pound in the tubes—the only time the hammer was
        used on Apollo 11—but was unable to penetrate more than 6 inches (15 cm) deep.
        The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension
        handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they
        had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34
        minutes. Aldrin shoveled 6 kilograms (13 lb) of soil into the box of rocks
        to pack them in tightly.[159] Two types of rocks were found in the geological
        samples: basalt and breccia.[160] Three new minerals were discovered in the
        rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and
        pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.
        All have subsequently been found on Earth.[161]\nThe plaque left on the ladder
        of Eagle\nWhile on the surface, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the
        LM ladder, bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres),
        an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The
        inscription read:\nHere men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the
        Moon July 1969, A. D. We came in peace for all mankind.[15]\nAt the behest
        of the Nixon administration to add a reference to God, NASA included the vague
        date as a reason to include A.D., which stands for Anno Domini (\"in the year
        of our Lord\").[162]\nMission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong
        his metabolic rates were high, and that he should slow down. He was moving
        rapidly from task to task as time ran out. As metabolic rates remained generally
        lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control
        granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.[158] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong
        explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk''s time and distance because
        there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts'' PLSS
        backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working
        on the Moon.[163]\nLunar ascent\nAldrin entered Eagle first. With some difficulty
        the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms
        (47.5 lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley
        device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC). This proved to be an inefficient
        tool, and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the
        LM by hand.[138] Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his
        sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. Armstrong then jumped onto
        the ladder''s third rung, and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM
        life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar
        orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad
        camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:11:13. They
        then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.[164]\nAldrin next to the
        Passive Seismic Experiment Package with the Lunar Module Eagle in the background\nPresidential
        speech writer William Safire had prepared an In Event of Moon Disaster announcement
        for Nixon to read in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the
        Moon.[165] The remarks were in a memo from Safire to Nixon''s White House
        Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration
        might follow in reaction to such a disaster.[166][167] According to the plan,
        Mission Control would \"close down communications\" with the LM, and a clergyman
        would \"commend their souls to the deepest of the deep\" in a public ritual
        likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text contained an
        allusion to Rupert Brooke''s World War I poem \"The Soldier\".[167] The script
        for the speech does not make reference to Collins; as he remained onboard
        Columbia in orbit around the Moon, it was expected that he would be able to
        return the module to Earth in the event of a mission failure.[168]\nWhile
        moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that
        would arm the main engine for liftoff from the Moon. There was a concern this
        would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. The nonconductive
        tip of a Duro felt-tip pen[169] was sufficient to activate the switch.[164]\nAfter
        more than 21\n+\n1⁄2 hours on the lunar surface, in addition to the scientific
        instruments, the astronauts left behind: an Apollo 1 mission patch in memory
        of astronauts Roger Chaffee, Gus Grissom, and Edward White, who died when
        their command module caught fire during a test in January 1967; two memorial
        medals of Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin, who died in
        1967 and 1968 respectively; a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an
        olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace; and a silicon message disk
        carrying the goodwill statements by presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson,
        and Nixon along with messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world.[170]
        The disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing
        of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for
        the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA''s past and then-current top management.[171]\nMap
        showing landing site and photos taken\nAfter about seven hours of rest, the
        crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. At that time,
        unknown to them, some hundred kilometers away from them the Soviet probe Luna
        15 was about to descend and impact. Despite having been known to be orbiting
        the Moon at the same time, through a ground-breaking precautious goodwill
        exchange of data, the mission control of Luna 15 unexpectedly hastened its
        robotic sample-return mission, initiating descent, in an attempt to return
        before Apollo 11.[172] Just two hours before Apollo 11''s launch Luna 15 crashed
        at 15:50 UTC, with British astronomers monitoring Luna 15 and recording the
        situation one commented: \"I say, this has really been drama of the highest
        order\",[173] bringing the Space Race to a culmination.[174]\nRoughly two
        hours later, at 17:54:00 UTC, the Apollo 11 crew on the surface safely lifted
        off in Eagle''s ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.[146]
        Film taken from the LM ascent stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the
        American flag, planted some 25 feet (8 m) from the descent stage, whipping
        violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time
        to witness the flag topple: \"The ascent stage of the LM separated ... I was
        concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator,
        but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.\"[175] Subsequent Apollo
        missions planted their flags farther from the LM.[176]\nColumbia in lunar
        orbit\nDuring his day flying solo around the Moon, Collins never felt lonely.
        Although it has been said \"not since Adam has any human known such solitude\",[177]
        Collins felt very much a part of the mission. In his autobiography he wrote:
        \"this venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third
        to be as necessary as either of the other two\".[177] In the 48 minutes of
        each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth while Columbia
        passed round the far side of the Moon, the feeling he reported was not fear
        or loneliness, but rather \"awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence,
        almost exultation\".[177]\nOne of Collins'' first tasks was to identify the
        Lunar Module on the ground. To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission
        Control radioed that they believed the Lunar Module landed about 4 miles (6.4
        km) off target. Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site,
        he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side
        of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess
        water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and
        Aldrin to return.[178]\nJust before he reached the dark side on the third
        orbit, Mission Control informed Collins there was a problem with the temperature
        of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of Columbia might freeze. Mission
        Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control
        System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the
        system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on
        with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature.
        When Columbia came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was
        able to report that the problem had been resolved. For the next couple of
        orbits, he described his time on the back side of the Moon as \"relaxing\".
        After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could
        be rested for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for Eagle to meet
        up with Columbia, Collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would
        fly Columbia down to meet Eagle.[179]\nReturn\nEagle''s ascent stage approaching
        Columbia\nEagle rendezvoused with Columbia at 21:24 UTC on July 21, and the
        two docked at 21:35. Eagle''s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit
        at 23:41.[9] Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was
        still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle''s
        orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \"uncertain location\"
        on the lunar surface.[180] In 2021, however, some calculations show that the
        lander may still be in orbit.[181]\nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown,
        the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented:
        \"All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number
        of people ... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are
        thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say,
        ''Thank you very much''.\"[182] Aldrin added: \"This has been far more than
        three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government
        and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that
        this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore
        the unknown ...\"[182]\nArmstrong concluded:\nThe responsibility for this
        flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded
        this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will,
        indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses,
        for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that
        built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little
        EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar
        surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built
        the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their
        hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight,
        we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening
        and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.[182]\nOn the
        return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially
        preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular
        repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles
        Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the
        housing and pack it with grease. Greg was later thanked by Armstrong.[183]\nSplashdown
        and quarantine\nColumbia floats on the ocean as Navy divers assist in retrieving
        the astronauts.\nThe aircraft carrier USS Hornet, under the command of Captain
        Carl J. Seiberlich,[184] was selected as the primary recovery ship (PRS) for
        Apollo 11 on June 5, replacing her sister ship, the LPH USS Princeton, which
        had recovered Apollo 10 on May 26. Hornet was then at her home port of Long
        Beach, California.[185] On reaching Pearl Harbor on July 5, Hornet embarked
        the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King helicopters of HS-4, a unit which specialized in
        recovery of Apollo spacecraft, specialized divers of UDT Detachment Apollo,
        a 35-man NASA recovery team, and about 120 media representatives. To make
        room, most of Hornet''s air wing was left behind in Long Beach. Special recovery
        equipment was also loaded, including a boilerplate command module used for
        training.[186]\nOn July 12, with Apollo 11 still on the launch pad, Hornet
        departed Pearl Harbor for the recovery area in the central Pacific,[187] in
        the vicinity of 10°36′N 172°24′E.[188] A presidential party consisting of
        Nixon, Borman, Secretary of State William P. Rogers and National Security
        Advisor Henry Kissinger flew to Johnston Atoll on Air Force One, then to the
        command ship USS Arlington in Marine One. After a night on board, they would
        fly to Hornet in Marine One for a few hours of ceremonies. On arrival aboard
        Hornet, the party was greeted by the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC),
        Admiral John S. McCain Jr., and NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine, who flew
        to Hornet from Pago Pago in one of Hornet''s carrier onboard delivery aircraft.[189]\nWeather
        satellites were not yet common, but US Air Force Captain Hank Brandli had
        access to top-secret spy satellite images. He realized that a storm front
        was headed for the Apollo recovery area. Poor visibility which could make
        locating the capsule difficult, and strong upper-level winds which \"would
        have ripped their parachutes to shreds\" according to Brandli, posed a serious
        threat to the safety of the mission.[190] Brandli alerted Navy Captain Willard
        S. Houston Jr., the commander of the Fleet Weather Center at Pearl Harbor,
        who had the required security clearance. On their recommendation, Rear Admiral
        Donald C. Davis, commander of Manned Spaceflight Recovery Forces, Pacific,
        advised NASA to change the recovery area, each man risking his career. A new
        location was selected 215 nautical miles (398 km) northeast.[191][192]\nThis
        altered the flight plan. A different sequence of computer programs was used,
        one never before attempted. In a conventional entry, trajectory event P64
        was followed by P67. For a skip-out re-entry, P65 and P66 were employed to
        handle the exit and entry parts of the skip. In this case, because they were
        extending the re-entry but not actually skipping out, P66 was not invoked
        and instead, P65 led directly to P67. The crew were also warned they would
        not be in a full-lift (heads-down) attitude when they entered P67.[191] The
        first program''s acceleration subjected the astronauts to 6.5 standard gravities
        (64 m/s2); the second, to 6.0 standard gravities (59 m/s2).[193]\nBefore dawn
        on July 24, Hornet launched four Sea King helicopters and three Grumman E-1
        Tracers. Two of the E-1s were designated as \"air boss\" while the third acted
        as a communications relay aircraft. Two of the Sea Kings carried divers and
        recovery equipment. The third carried photographic equipment, and the fourth
        carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon.[194] At 16:44
        UTC (05:44 local time) Columbia''s drogue parachutes were deployed. This was
        observed by the helicopters. Seven minutes later Columbia struck the water
        forcefully 2,660 km (1,440 nmi) east of Wake Island, 380 km (210 nmi) south
        of Johnston Atoll, and 24 km (13 nmi) from Hornet,[9][191] at 13°19′N 169°9′W.[195]
        82 °F (28 °C) with 6 feet (1.8 m) seas and winds at 17 knots (31 km/h; 20
        mph) from the east were reported under broken clouds at 1,500 feet (460 m)
        with visibility of 10 nautical miles (19 km; 12 mi) at the recovery site.[196]
        Reconnaissance aircraft flying to the original splashdown location reported
        the conditions Brandli and Houston had predicted.[197]\nDuring splashdown,
        Columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation
        bags activated by the astronauts.[198] A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering
        above attached a sea anchor to prevent it from drifting.[199] More divers
        attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for
        astronaut extraction.[200]\nCrew of Apollo 11 in quarantine after returning
        to Earth, visited by Richard Nixon\nApollo 11 Mobile Quarantine Facility on
        display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia in 2009\nThe divers
        then passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted
        them into the life raft. The possibility of bringing back pathogens from the
        lunar surface was considered remote, but NASA took precautions at the recovery
        site. The astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution
        and Columbia wiped with Povidone-iodine to remove any lunar dust that might
        be present. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter.
        BIGs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board Hornet. The
        raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk.[198]\nAfter
        touchdown on Hornet at 17:53 UTC, the helicopter was lowered by the elevator
        into the hangar bay, where the astronauts walked the 30 feet (9.1 m) to the
        mobile quarantine facility (MQF), where they would begin the Earth-based portion
        of their 21 days of quarantine.[201] This practice would continue for two
        more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven
        to be barren of life, and the quarantine process dropped.[202][203] Nixon
        welcomed the astronauts back to Earth. He told them: \"[A]s a result of what
        you''ve done, the world has never been closer together before.\"[204]\nAfter
        Nixon departed, Hornet was brought alongside the 5-short-ton (4.5 t) Columbia,
        which was lifted aboard by the ship''s crane, placed on a dolly and moved
        next to the MQF. It was then attached to the MQF with a flexible tunnel, allowing
        the lunar samples, film, data tapes and other items to be removed. Hornet
        returned to Pearl Harbor, where the MQF was loaded onto a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter
        and airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center. The astronauts arrived at the
        Lunar Receiving Laboratory at 10:00 UTC on July 28. Columbia was taken to
        Ford Island for deactivation, and its pyrotechnics made safe. It was then
        taken to Hickham Air Force Base, from whence it was flown to Houston in a
        Douglas C-133 Cargomaster, reaching the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on July
        30.[205]\nIn accordance with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of
        regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol,[206]
        the astronauts continued in quarantine. After three weeks in confinement (first
        in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on Hornet, and finally in
        the Lunar Receiving Laboratory), the astronauts were given a clean bill of
        health.[207] On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination
        met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had
        joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project
        engineer John Hirasaki),[208] and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from
        the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released
        for study.[209]\nAugust 13, 1969 - New York City\nCelebrations\nFollowing
        their return to Earth, the Apollo 11 crew received widespread international
        acclaim. On August 13, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael
        Collins were honored with ticker-tape parades in New York City and Chicago,
        with an estimated six million people lining the streets.[210] That evening,
        a state dinner was held in Los Angeles at the Century Plaza Hotel to commemorate
        the historic achievement. The event was attended by members of Congress, 44
        state governors, Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger and his
        predecessor Earl Warren, as well as ambassadors from 83 nations. President
        Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew awarded each astronaut the Presidential
        Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States.[211]\nApollo
        11 Astronauts - New York City - August 13, 1969\nOn September 16, the astronauts
        addressed a joint session of Congress, where they presented two American flags—one
        to the House of Representatives and one to the Senate—that had traveled to
        the lunar surface aboard Eagle.[212]\nOne of the mission flags carried aboard
        the flight—the Flag of American Samoa—was later displayed at the Jean P. Haydon
        Museum in Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, recognizing the territory’s
        support role as a recovery staging area.[213]\nTerrazzo tribute to Apollo
        11 astronauts on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nThe celebrations continued with
        a 38-day world goodwill tour titled “Giant Leap”, which began on September
        29 and concluded on November 5, 1969. The astronauts visited 22 countries
        and met with numerous heads of state, prime ministers, royalty, and civic
        leaders.[214] The tour, intended to thank the international community for
        their support of the space program, began in Mexico City and ended in Tokyo.[215]
        Notable stops included Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Paris,
        Amsterdam, Brussels, London, Rome, Belgrade, Tehran, Mumbai, Bangkok, Sydney,
        Guam, and Honolulu.[216] Crowds in the tens or hundreds of thousands gathered
        to greet the astronauts in each city.\nNumerous countries and organizations
        honored the Moon landing by issuing special commemorative items. These included
        postage stamps, coins, medals, plaques, and magazine features. TIME, National
        Geographic, LIFE, and dozens of international publications featured the astronauts
        on their covers. Many of these commemoratives are now held in public and private
        collections, and some were placed aboard later Apollo missions in symbolic
        tribute.[217]\nAdditionally, the success of Apollo 11 contributed to a brief
        spike in interest in science and technology education, often referred to as
        the “Apollo effect,” influencing a generation of engineers and scientists.[218]\n8-Day

        Has Landed'' – Two Men Walk on the Moon\"\nHumans walking on the Moon and
        returning safely to Earth accomplished Kennedy''s goal set eight years earlier.
        In Mission Control during the Apollo 11 landing, Kennedy''s speech flashed
        on the screen, followed by the words \"TASK ACCOMPLISHED, July 1969\".[219]
        The success of Apollo 11 demonstrated the United States'' technological superiority;[219]
        and with the success of Apollo 11, America had won the Space Race.[220][221]\nNew
        phrases permeated into the English language. \"If they can send a man to the
        Moon, why can''t they ...?\" became a common saying following Apollo 11.[222]
        Armstrong''s words on the lunar surface also spun off various parodies.[220]\nWhile
        most people celebrated the accomplishment, disenfranchised Americans saw it
        as a symbol of the divide in America, evidenced by protesters led by Ralph
        Abernathy outside of Kennedy Space Center the day before Apollo 11 launched.[223]
        NASA Administrator Thomas Paine met with Abernathy at the occasion, both hoping
        that the space program can spur progress also in other regards, such as poverty
        in the US.[224] Paine was then asked, and agreed, to host protesters as spectators
        at the launch,[224] and Abernathy, awestruck by the spectacle,[107] prayed
        for the astronauts.[224] Racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens
        who wondered why money spent on the Apollo program was not spent taking care
        of humans on Earth. A poem by Gil Scott-Heron called \"Whitey on the Moon\"
        (1970) illustrated the racial inequality in the United States that was highlighted
        by the Space Race.[220][225][226] The poem starts with:\nA rat done bit my
        sister Nell.\n(with Whitey on the moon)\nHer face and arms began to swell.\n(and
        Whitey''s on the moon)\nI can''t pay no doctor bill.\n(but Whitey''s on the
        moon)\nTen years from now I''ll be paying still.\n(while Whitey''s on the
        moon)\n[...][226]\nTwenty percent of the world''s population watched humans
        walk on the Moon for the first time.[227] While Apollo 11 sparked the interest
        of the world, the follow-on Apollo missions did not hold the interest of the
        nation.[219] One possible explanation was the shift in complexity. Landing
        someone on the Moon was an easy goal to understand; lunar geology was too
        abstract for the average person. Another is that Kennedy''s goal of landing
        humans on the Moon had already been accomplished.[228] A well-defined objective
        helped Project Apollo accomplish its goal, but after it was completed it was
        hard to justify continuing the lunar missions.[229][230]\nWhile most Americans
        were proud of their nation''s achievements in space exploration, only once
        during the late 1960s did the Gallup Poll indicate that a majority of Americans
        favored \"doing more\" in space as opposed to \"doing less\". By 1973, 59
        percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration. The
        Space Race had been won, and Cold War tensions were easing as the US and Soviet
        Union entered the era of détente. This was also a time when inflation was
        rising, which put pressure on the government to reduce spending. The space
        program was saved due to the perception that it was one of the few government
        programs that had achieved something great. Drastic cuts, warned Caspar Weinberger,
        the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, might send a signal
        that \"our best years are behind us\".[231]\nAfter the Apollo 11 mission,
        officials from the Soviet Union said landing humans on the Moon was dangerous
        and unnecessary. At the time the Soviet Union was attempting to retrieve lunar
        samples robotically. The Soviets publicly denied there was a race to the Moon,
        and indicated they were not making an attempt.[232] Mstislav Keldysh said
        in July 1969, \"We are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite
        systems.\" It was revealed in 1989 that the Soviets had tried to send people
        to the Moon, but were unable due to technological difficulties.[233] The public''s
        reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the
        release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction.
        A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion
        was angered by it.[234]\nThe Apollo 11 landing is referenced in the songs
        \"Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins\" by the Byrds on the 1969 album Ballad of
        Easy Rider, \"Coon on the Moon\" by Howlin'' Wolf on the 1973 album The Back
        Door Wolf, and \"One Small Step\" by Ayreon on the 2000 album Universal Migrator
        Part 1: The Dream Sequencer.\nSpacecraft\nColumbia on display in the Milestones
        of Flight exhibition hall at the National Air and Space Museum\nThe command
        module Columbia went on a tour of the United States, visiting 49 state capitals,
        the District of Columbia, and Anchorage, Alaska.[235] In 1971, it was transferred
        to the Smithsonian Institution, and was displayed at the National Air and
        Space Museum (NASM) in Washington, DC.[236] It was in the central Milestones
        of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing
        the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer,
        Spirit of St. Louis, Bell X-1, North American X-15 and Friendship 7.[237]\nColumbia
        was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven
        F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, to be readied for a four-city
        tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. This included Space Center
        Houston from October 14, 2017, to March 18, 2018, the Saint Louis Science
        Center from April 14 to September 3, 2018, the Senator John Heinz History
        Center in Pittsburgh from September 29, 2018, to February 18, 2019, and its
        last location at Museum of Flight in Seattle from March 16 to September 2,
        2019.[236][238] Continued renovations at the Smithsonian allowed time for
        an additional stop for the capsule, and it was moved to the Cincinnati Museum
        Center. The ribbon cutting ceremony was on September 29, 2019.[239]\nFor 40
        years Armstrong''s and Aldrin''s space suits were displayed in the museum''s
        Apollo to the Moon exhibit,[240] until it permanently closed on December 3,
        2018, to be replaced by a new gallery which was scheduled to open in 2022.
        A special display of Armstrong''s suit was unveiled for the 50th anniversary
        of Apollo 11 in July 2019.[241][242] The quarantine trailer, the flotation
        collar and the flotation bags are in the Smithsonian''s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy
        Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia,
        where they are on display along with a test lunar module.[243][244][245]\nArmstrong''s
        space suit on display at the National Air and Space Museum in its new exhibit\nThe
        descent stage of the LM Eagle remains on the Moon. In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance
        Orbiter (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the
        Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages
        of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the
        astronauts.[246]\nThe remains of the ascent stage are assumed to lie at an
        unknown location on the lunar surface. The ascent stage, Eagle, was not tracked
        after it was jettisoned. The lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform
        to make low Moon orbits unstable after a short time, leading the orbiting
        object to impact the surface.[247] However, using a program developed by NASA,
        and high-resolution lunar gravity data, a paper was published, in 2021, indicating
        that Eagle might still be in orbit as late as 2020. Using the orbital elements
        published by NASA, a Monte Carlo method was used to generate parameter sets
        that bracket the uncertainties in these elements. All simulations, of the
        orbit, predicted that Eagle would never impact the lunar surface.[248]\nF-1
        Engine Injector Plate on temporary display at the Cincinnati Museum Center
        in 2019\nIn March 2012 a team of specialists financed by Amazon founder Jeff
        Bezos located the F-1 engines from the S-IC stage that launched Apollo 11
        into space. They were found on the Atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning.[249]
        His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July
        2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the
        engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from Apollo 11.[250][251]
        The S-IVB third stage which performed Apollo 11''s trans-lunar injection remains
        in a solar orbit near to that of Earth.[252]\nPieces of fabric and wood from
        the first airplane, the 1903 Wright Flyer, traveled to the Moon in Apollo
        11''s Lunar Module Eagle and are displayed at the Wright Brothers National
        Memorial.\nMoon rocks\nThe main repository for the Apollo Moon rocks is the
        Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in
        Houston, Texas. For safekeeping, there is also a smaller collection stored
        at White Sands Test Facility near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Most of the rocks
        are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture. They are handled only
        indirectly, using special tools. Over 100 research laboratories worldwide
        conduct studies of the samples; approximately 500 samples are prepared and
        sent to investigators every year.[253][254]\nIn November 1969, Nixon asked
        NASA to make up about 250 presentation Apollo 11 lunar sample displays for
        135 nations, the fifty states of the United States and its possessions, and
        the United Nations. Each display included Moon dust from Apollo 11 and flags,
        including one of the Soviet Union, taken along by Apollo 11. The rice-sized
        particles were four small pieces of Moon soil weighing about 50 mg and were
        enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a United States half-dollar
        coin. This acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust. Nixon gave the
        Apollo 11 lunar sample displays as goodwill gifts in 1970.[255][256]\nExperiment
        results\nThe Passive Seismic Experiment ran until the command uplink failed
        on August 25, 1969. The downlink failed on December 14, 1969.[257] As of 2018,
        the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment remains operational.[258]\nMoonwalk camera\nThe
        Hasselblad camera used during the moonwalk was thought to be lost or left
        on the Moon surface.[259]\nLunar Module Eagle memorabilia\nIn 2015, after
        Armstrong died in 2012, his widow contacted the National Air and Space Museum
        to inform them she had found a white cloth bag in one of Armstrong''s closets.
        The bag contained various items, which should have been left behind in the
        Lunar Module Eagle, including the 16mm Data Acquisition Camera that had been
        used to capture images of the first Moon landing.[260][261] The camera is
        currently on display at the National Air and Space Museum.[262]\nAnniversary
        events\nFurther information: Apollo 11 anniversaries\n40th anniversary\nColumbia
        at the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar\nOn July 15, 2009, Life.com released
        a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by
        Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch.[263] From July
        16 to 24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in
        real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.[264] It is in
        the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key
        moments.[265] In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage
        shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was
        re-synchronized and released for the first time.[266] The John F. Kennedy
        Presidential Library and Museum set up an Adobe Flash website that rebroadcasts
        the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.[267]\nOn
        July 20, 2009, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with President Barack Obama
        at the White House.[268] \"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation
        of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next
        Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin\", Obama said. \"We want to make sure that
        NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\"[269]
        On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional
        Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was
        sponsored by Florida Senator Bill Nelson and Florida Representative Alan Grayson.[270][271]\nA
        group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events
        reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\nIt was carried out in
        a technically brilliant way with risks taken ... that would be inconceivable
        in the risk-averse world of today ... The Apollo programme is arguably the
        greatest technical achievement of mankind to date ... nothing since Apollo
        has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts—Armstrong,
        Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.[272]\n50th anniversary\nFurther
        information: Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins\nOn June 10, 2015,
        Congressman Bill Posey introduced resolution H.R. 2726 to the 114th session
        of the United States House of Representatives directing the United States
        Mint to design and sell commemorative coins in gold, silver and clad for the
        50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. On January 24, 2019, the Mint released
        the Apollo 11 Fiftieth Anniversary commemorative coins to the public on its
        website.[273][274]\nA documentary film, Apollo 11, with restored footage of
        the 1969 event, premiered in IMAX on March 1, 2019, and broadly in theaters
        on March 8.[275][276]\nThe Smithsonian Institute''s National Air and Space
        Museum and NASA sponsored the \"Apollo 50 Festival\" on the National Mall
        in Washington DC. The three-day (July 18 to 20, 2019) outdoor festival featured
        hands-on exhibits and activities, live performances, and speakers such as
        Adam Savage and NASA scientists.[277]\nSaturn V rocket projected onto the
        Washington Monument during the Apollo 11 50th anniversary show\nAs part of
        the festival, a projection of the 363-foot (111 m) tall Saturn V rocket was
        displayed on the east face of the 555-foot (169 m) tall Washington Monument
        from July 16 through the 20th from 9:30 pm until 11:30 pm (EDT). The program
        also included a 17-minute show that combined full-motion video projected on
        the Washington Monument to recreate the assembly and launch of the Saturn
        V rocket. The projection was joined by a 40-foot (12 m) wide recreation of
        the Kennedy Space Center countdown clock and two large video screens showing
        archival footage to recreate the time leading up to the moon landing. There
        were three shows per night on July 19–20, with the last show on Saturday,
        delayed slightly so the portion where Armstrong first set foot on the Moon
        would happen exactly 50 years to the second after the actual event.[278]\nOn
        July 19, 2019, the Google Doodle paid tribute to the Apollo 11 Moon landing,
        complete with a link to an animated YouTube video with voiceover by astronaut
        Michael Collins.[279][280]\nAldrin, Collins, and Armstrong''s sons were hosted

The mission achieved its historic goal of landing a man on the lunar surface, fulfilling President John F. Kennedy's challenge to the nation. The crew consisted of three astronauts:\n\n- **Neil Armstrong** (Commander)\n- **Buzz Aldrin** (Lunar Module Pilot)\n- **Michael Collins** (Command Module Pilot)\n\nThe Lunar Module, named **Eagle**, successfully landed on the Moon on **July 20, 1969**, at **20:17 UTC** in an area known as **Tranquility Base**. Approximately six hours later, at **02:56 UTC on July 21**, Neil Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon, followed by Buzz Aldrin 19 minutes later. They spent about **two and a half hours** on the lunar surface, collecting lunar material and conducting experiments.\n\n### Screenshots of Important Pages\n- ![Apollo 11 Overview](tmp/screenshots/apollo_11_overview.png)\n- ![Apollo 11 Moon Landing](tmp/screenshots/apollo_11_moon_landing.png)\n\n### Key Dates and Mission Objectives\n- **Launch Date:** July 16, 1969, 13:32:00 UTC\n- **Lunar Landing:** July 20, 1969, 20:17:40 UTC\n- **First Moonwalk:** July 21, 1969, 02:56:15 UTC\n- **Splashdown:** July 24, 1969, 16:35:35 UTC\n- **Mission Duration:** 8 days, 3 hours, 18 minutes, and 35 seconds\n\n**Mission Objectives:**\n1. Land humans on the Moon and return them safely to Earth.\n2. Conduct scientific experiments and collect lunar samples.\n3. Demonstrate the performance of the Lunar Module.\n\n### Historical Significance\nApollo 11 marked a pivotal moment in human history, symbolizing a **U.S. victory in the Space Race** against the Soviet Union. Neil Armstrong's famous words, \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind,\" resonated globally, inspiring generations to pursue exploration and scientific endeavors. The mission not only showcased technological prowess but also united people worldwide in a moment of awe.\n\n### Crew Members\n1. **Neil Armstrong**\n   - First human to walk on the Moon.\n   - Commanded the Apollo 11 mission.\n   - Known for his calm demeanor under pressure.\n\n2. **Buzz Aldrin**\n   - Second human to walk on the Moon.\n   - Contributed to the lunar exploration and sample collection.\n   - Known for his enthusiasm for space travel and science.\n\n3. **Michael Collins**\n   - Piloted the Command Module, remaining in lunar orbit.\n   - Played a critical role in ensuring the mission's success.\n   - Noted for his reflections on solitude during the mission.\n\n### Related Missions and Events\n- **Apollo 10:** The \"dress rehearsal\" for Apollo 11, where the Lunar Module was tested in lunar orbit.\n- **Luna 15:** A Soviet robotic mission that attempted to land on the Moon shortly before Apollo 11's landing but crashed.\n\n### Summary\nThe success of Apollo 11 not only accomplished the goal of landing humans on the Moon but also served as a testament to human ingenuity and determination. The mission has had lasting impacts on space exploration, technology, and international cooperation in scientific endeavors.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the full article on [Apollo 11 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11).",
