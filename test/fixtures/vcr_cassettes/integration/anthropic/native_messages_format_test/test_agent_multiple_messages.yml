        LLMs (Large Language Models) are AI programs that understand and generate
        text.\n\nHere''s how they work in simple terms:\n\n**What they do:**\n- Read
        and write text that sounds human\n- Answer questions, write essays, code,
        translate languages, and more\n\n**How they learn:**\n- They''re trained on
        massive amounts of text from books, websites, and articles\n- They learn patterns
        - like which words typically go together and how sentences are structured\n-
        Think of it like someone who''s read millions of books and learned how language
        works\n\n**How they respond:**\n- When you ask something, they predict what
        words should come next based on their training\n- They don''t truly \"understand\"
        like humans do - they''re recognizing patterns\n- They generate responses
        word by word, choosing what''s most likely to fit\n\n**Key limitations:**\n-
        They don''t have real knowledge or beliefs\n- They can make mistakes or \"hallucinate\"
        false information\n- They don''t have access to current events (unless specifically
        updated)\n- They can''t learn from conversations permanently\n\nThink of an
        LLM as an incredibly well-read assistant that''s very good at pattern matching
        in language, but doesn''t actually \"think\" the way humans do.\n\nDoes that
        help? Any part you''d like me to explain more?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":38,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":282,"service_tier":"standard"}}'
