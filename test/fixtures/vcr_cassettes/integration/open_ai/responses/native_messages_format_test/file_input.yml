Letter to Shareholders\n\n**Tone and Intent:**  \n- Warren Buffett emphasizes a candid, forthright style, discussing both successes and failures.\n- He references his philosophy, shaped partly by Charlie Munger: \u201cpraise by name, criticize by category\u201d.\n\n**Mistakes Acknowledged:**  \n- Buffett is open about errors he has made in investment decisions and personnel choices, contrasting this with less candid corporate communication elsewhere.\n\n### 2.

Tax Payment Record\n\n- Berkshire paid **$26.8 billion** in federal corporate income taxes in 2024 \u2014 more than any other US company that year.\n- Praise for the ongoing reinvestment culture at Berkshire.\n\n### 7. Investment Philosophy and Portfolio\n\n- Discusses divided approach: wholly-owned subsidiaries vs. major minority stakes in outstanding companies (Apple, Coke, AmEx, Moody\u2019s, etc).\n- Reduces holdings in publicly traded equities from $354B to $272B, but controlled private operations\u2019 value rose.\n- Restates commitment to equities as the main investment, especially US equities.\n\n### 8. Capitalism and the \u201cAmerican Miracle\u201d\n\n- Buffett frames Berkshire\u2019s success within the broader context of US capitalism and compounding, crediting the US system for the company\u2019s achievements.\n\n### 9. Property-Casualty Insurance Discussion\n\n- In-depth discussion of **insurance as Berkshire\u2019s core business**.\n- Describes the peculiar float-based business model, risk factors, and emphasis on underwriting profitability.\n- Insurance segment generated $32 billion in after-tax profits over 20 years, float grew from $46 billion to $171 billion.\n\n### 10. Japanese Investments\n\n- Ongoing and growing investments in five Japanese trading houses (ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo).\n- Berkshire holds less than 10%, but this threshold has been relaxed.\n- Yen-denominated borrowing used as a partial currency-hedge.\n- At year-end, market value $23.5 billion (cost $13.8 billion).\n\n### 11. The Annual Meeting in Omaha\n\n- Details on the 2025 shareholder meeting: schedules, book sales, including a new edition of \u201c60 Years of Berkshire Hathaway\u201d focused on Charlie Munger.\n- Anecdotes about family attending.\n\n### 12. Historical Performance Data\n\nA **year-by-year table** comparing Berkshire\u2019s per-share market value change to the S&P 500\u2019s total return (1965\u20132024) showing:\n- Berkshire\u2019s compounded annual gain since 1965: **19.9%**\n- S&P 500 compounded: **10.4%**\n- Overall gain: Berkshire 5,502,284%, S&P 500 39,054% over the period.\n\n---\n\n## In Summary\n\nThis file is essentially **Warren Buffett\u2019s annual shareholders letter for 2024**, including a mix of Berkshire\u2019s business philosophy, operational review, stories and anecdotes, performance tables, and a clear-eyed look at both achievements and errors. \n\n**If you have a particular section or topic you want more detail about, let me know!**"
