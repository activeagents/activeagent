Total gain: 5,502,284% vs 39,054% for the S&P.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of What This File Is:**\n- The official **2024 Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letter** (from Warren Buffett).\n- Discusses business performance, investment philosophy, company culture, insurance operations, tax history, leadership succession, international investments, and historical returns.\n- Written in Buffett\u2019s accessible, candid, and storytelling style, combining business results with personal observations.\n\n**If you have questions about specific sections or want key takeaways, quotes, or data extracted from particular parts, let me know!**"
