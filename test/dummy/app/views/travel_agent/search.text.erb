Travel Search Results
====================

Searching for flights from <%= @departure %> to <%= @destination %>

Available flights:
<% @results.each_with_index do |flight, i| %>
<%= i + 1 %>. <%= flight[:airline] %> - $<%= flight[:price] %> (Departure: <%= flight[:departure] %>)
<% end %>

Please let me know which flight you'd like to book.
