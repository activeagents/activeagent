# Dev Console (Dashboard Engine)

The dashboard is its own gem. `activeagent` is the framework — agents,
providers, generation, telemetry reporting — and `actionagent` is a mountable
Rails engine that adds the dashboard on top of it: every agent generation
recorded as a trace with a span waterfall, a metrics overview, and the
agent builder, interactions and evaluations alongside them — running
inside your app against your own database while you build. The hosted
[activeagents.ai](https://activeagents.ai) platform mounts the same engine,
so what you see locally in development is what the platform shows (plus the
accounts, plans, billing and managed sandbox infrastructure a hosted
product has to have) once you point telemetry at it. Every platform
workspace starts with a free low-volume trial.

![Dashboard: traces list with expandable span timelines]

## Quick start

The dashboard's models are Active Record models and its runs persist
conversations, so `actionagent` adds `activerecord` and
[solid_agent](/solid_agent) on top of what the framework already pulls in —
neither of which `activeagent` itself requires. Add both gems:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "activeagent"
gem "actionagent"
```

```bash
bundle install
rails generate action_agent:install
rails db:migrate
```

The generator:

- copies two migrations — `active_agent_telemetry_traces` (the trace store)
  and `active_agent_dashboard_tables` (agents, runs, versions,
  conversations, evaluations, sandboxes, recordings, keys); pass
  `--traces_only` for a trace sink alone,
- mounts the engine at `/activeagents`,
- writes `config/initializers/action_agent.rb`.

API keys and provider credentials are encrypted at rest, so run
`rails db:encryption:init` before creating any (or set
`ActionAgent.encrypt_credentials = false` to store them in plain
text — a deliberate downgrade, not a default).

Deploying this beyond your laptop — for a team, or as the trace sink for
a fleet of apps? See
[Self-Hosted Observability](/framework/self-hosted-observability).

Then enable telemetry with local storage in `config/active_agent.yml`:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  local_storage: true
```

That's it. Run any agent and open `/activeagents` — each generation
appears as a trace with prompt/LLM/tool spans, timing, token usage
(input / output / thinking), provider and model. The dashboard's React
bundle ships prebuilt in the `actionagent` gem, so mounting it doesn't ask
your app to run a JavaScript build.

`local_storage: true` writes traces through the engine's trace model, so it
only works in the app that mounts the engine. Without `actionagent`
installed, telemetry logs that it has nowhere to write — apps that only run
agents point telemetry at an `endpoint:` instead (see below).

## What you get

| Page | Path | Contents |
|------|------|----------|
| Agents | `/activeagents` | Your agents with per-agent request, token and error stats; build, edit, version and run them |
| Traces | `/activeagents/traces` | Every generation: agent + action, status, duration, tokens; expandable span timeline; All/Errors filter; 30s auto-refresh |
| Metrics | `/activeagents/metrics` | Last-24h totals: traces, tokens, avg duration, error rate, active agents; per-agent statistics |
| Interactions | `/activeagents/interactions` | The conversations behind the traces: messages, tool calls, generations |
| Evaluations | `/activeagents/evaluations` | Scored agent outputs, and scenario suites replayed across models (see below) |
| Console | `/activeagents/console/traces` | The same traces and metrics server-rendered, without JavaScript; span waterfall per trace at `/activeagents/console/traces/:id` |
| Ingest API | `POST /activeagents/api/traces` | JSON trace ingestion from other apps and SDKs (`local_storage` writes through the model instead, no HTTP) |

Time-series charts on the console's metrics page use the optional
[groupdate](https://github.com/ankane/groupdate) gem when present and
degrade gracefully without it; the React metrics page does its own hourly
bucketing and needs nothing extra.

## Scenario evaluations

An evaluation scores an agent one of two ways. Without scenarios it samples
the agent's recent recorded generations and scores them against rule,
telemetry and LLM-judge criteria. With scenarios it **replays** a list of
user messages you paste in — one fresh run per scenario, per candidate model
— and reports which tasks the agent completes, what the failures have in
common, and what to change. That is how to answer "can this agent do these
new tasks with the tools it has?" and "how does a frontier model compare with
the latest open-weights model on my workload?" without waiting for traffic.

Paste scenarios into the **Scenarios** field of the New Evaluation form, or
through the API (`scenarios_text`, or a `scenarios` array). One message per
line; `# Heading` lines group related tasks so a group can be run on its own;
options after `|` set expectations:

```text
# Find records
Which gynecologists in Charlotte have scheduling enabled? | tools: find_records
Show me all providers with no license on file
# Blame
Who changed the biography for Dr. AbdelRazek? | contains: AbdelRazek
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tools: a, b` | A passing answer calls at least one of these tools |
| `contains: x, y` | The answer must contain each pattern (substring or regex) |
| `not_contains: x` | The answer must not contain the pattern |
| `key: k` | A stable key, so results line up across re-imports |
| `group: g` | Overrides the heading for this line |

**Compare models** takes the candidates as a comma-separated list. A bare
name infers its provider from the family (`claude-*` → Anthropic, `gpt-*` →
OpenAI, `name:tag` → Ollama); prefix it to be explicit
(`ollama/qwen3:8b`, `openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`). Each
candidate needs credentials the same way an agent run does — the owner's
provider key or the host app's `config/active_agent.yml`.

A run is queued (`EvaluationRunJob`) and its results land as each replay
finishes. The expanded evaluation shows:

- **Per model** — pass rate, mean score, mean latency, tokens, estimated
  cost and fault counts, with the best model by pass rate (the judge writes
  the rationale when one is configured).
- **Recommendations** — the faults grouped across scenarios with the fix
  each calls for, and any tool the judge suggested adding.
- **The scenario × model matrix** — one row per scenario, one column per
  model; click a row for each model's answer, tool calls and diagnosis, or
  press *run* on the row to replay just that scenario.

A scenario passes when the run completed, met its expectations, and scored
at least 0.7 across the evaluation's criteria. Anything else carries exactly
one fault, assigned from the evidence in this order:

| Fault | Meaning | Typical fix |
|---|---|---|
| `run_error` | The replay raised, or the model returned nothing | Credentials, model name, throttling |
| `tool_error` | A tool the agent called returned an error | Fix the tool, or its parameter descriptions |
| `missing_capability` | The agent said no tool covers the task | Add the tool the recommendation names |
| `expected_tool_not_called` | The scenario expects a tool the agent did not call | Enable the tool, or sharpen its description / the instructions |
| `forbidden_content` / `missing_content` | A content expectation failed | Instructions, or the tool's output |
| `low_quality` | Criteria scored the answer below 0.7 | Read the answer against the weakest criterion |

`missing_capability` and `expected_tool_not_called` are the faults that
turn a pasted list of new tasks into a backlog: they say which tasks the
current toolset cannot reach and what to build.

The API: `POST /api/evaluations` with `scenarios_text`;
`POST /api/evaluations/:id/run` with `group`, `keys[]`, `scenario_ids[]`
and `models[]`; `GET /api/evaluations/:id/runs/:run_id` for the results;
`GET`/`PUT /api/evaluations/:id/scenarios` to read or replace the suite.

## Authentication

**The dashboard has no authentication by default.** Anyone who can reach
the route can read your traces. Before deploying anywhere non-local, set
an authentication method in the initializer:

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  # Any proc that authenticates the request — Devise, Rails 8 sessions, basic auth…
  config.authentication_method = ->(controller) do
    controller.authenticate_admin!
  end
end
```

Or constrain the mount in `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
authenticate :user, ->(u) { u.admin? } do
  mount ActionAgent::Engine => "/activeagents"
end
```

The local ingest endpoint accepts unauthenticated posts by default (it
receives traces from your own app process on your own machine). If the
mount is reachable from other machines, set `config.ingest_api_key` to
require a Bearer token — see
[Self-Hosted Observability](/framework/self-hosted-observability). In
multi-tenant mode ingest always authenticates per-account keys (see
below).

## Sending traces to a remote endpoint instead

Point telemetry at any compatible receiver — including the hosted
platform — instead of (or in addition to) local storage:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: https://api.activeagents.ai/v1/traces
  api_key: <%= ENV["ACTIVEAGENTS_API_KEY"] %>
```

The wire format is documented in [telemetry.md](./telemetry.md) under
"self-hosting endpoint requirements" — anything that speaks it can feed
or receive these traces.

## Multi-tenant mode (running your own platform)

The engine also supports account-scoped deployments — this is exactly how
the hosted platform runs it:

```ruby
ActionAgent.configure do |config|
  config.multi_tenant = true
  config.account_class = "Account"        # must have a telemetry_api_key column
  config.trace_model_class = "TelemetryTrace" # optional model override
end
```

In multi-tenant mode the ingest API authenticates with
`Authorization: Bearer <account.telemetry_api_key>` and processes traces
asynchronously through `ActionAgent::ProcessTelemetryTracesJob`
(idempotent per trace_id, capped at 100 traces per request). Add an
`increment_telemetry_usage!` method to your account model to hook usage
tracking or rate limiting.

## Relationship to the hosted platform

| | This engine | activeagents.ai (production) |
|---|---|---|
| Intended use | Development, or your own production mount | Managed production |
| Traces + span waterfall | ✓ | ✓ |
| Metrics + per-agent stats | ✓ | ✓ |
| Trace ingest API | ✓ (single tenant, local) | ✓ (multi-tenant, quotas) |
| Agent builder, runs, versions | ✓ | ✓ |
| Conversations, evaluations, scorecards, cost estimates | ✓ built in | ✓ |
| Accounts, plans, billing, managed sandboxes | Yours to operate | ✓ |

One gem, two contexts: it shows your traces while you develop, and the
platform runs the same engine multi-tenant with managed infrastructure. What
the platform adds is the business around it — accounts, plans, billing,
quotas and cloud sandboxes — not a bigger feature set. To run it as a
shared production surface of your own, see
[Self-Hosted Dashboard](/framework/self-hosted-observability).

## Conversation persistence

`actionagent` depends on
[solid_agent](https://github.com/activeagents/solid_agent), so it is already
in your bundle — the Interactions view is built on the contexts, messages and
generations `SolidAgent::HasContext` records, and dashboard runs persist
through it. The concern resolves those by name to solid_agent's own
`AgentContext`, `AgentMessage` and `AgentGeneration` models, so run its
installer once as well:

```bash
rails generate solid_agent:install
rails db:migrate
```

Include the same concern in your own agents to persist their conversations
alongside traces; generation records carry the same `trace_id` for
correlation:

```ruby
class ApplicationAgent < ActiveAgent::Base
  include SolidAgent::HasContext
  has_context contextual: :user
end
```

See [Persistence (SolidAgent)](/solid_agent) for the rest of what that gem
records — the tool exchange, long-term memory, runs and cost.
