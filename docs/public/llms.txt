# Active Agent

> ActiveAgent extends Rails MVC to AI interactions. Build intelligent agents using familiar patterns — controllers, actions, callbacks, and views. The AI framework for Rails with less code & more fun.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started](https://docs.activeagents.ai/getting_started): Build AI agents with Rails in minutes. Learn how to install, configure, and create your first agent.

## Framework

- [Active Agent](https://docs.activeagents.ai/framework): ActiveAgent extends Rails MVC to AI interactions. Build intelligent agents using familiar patterns—controllers, actions, callbacks, and views.
- [Agents](https://docs.activeagents.ai/agents): Controllers for AI interactions with actions, callbacks, views, and concerns that generate AI responses instead of rendering HTML.
- [Providers](https://docs.activeagents.ai/providers): Connect your agents to AI services through a unified interface. Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, or testing mocks without changing agent code.
- [Configuration](https://docs.activeagents.ai/framework/configuration): Flexible configuration for framework-level settings and provider-specific options. Configure retry strategies, logging, and multiple AI providers with environment-specific settings.
- [Instrumentation and Logging](https://docs.activeagents.ai/framework/instrumentation): Monitor provider operations using ActiveSupport::Notifications. Track performance metrics, debug generation flows, and integrate with external monitoring services.
- [Retries](https://docs.activeagents.ai/framework/retries): Automatic retry mechanisms for handling rate limits, timeouts, and transient errors using provider-native SDK retry strategies with exponential backoff.
- [Rails Integration](https://docs.activeagents.ai/framework/rails): Install ActiveAgent in Rails applications with generators for agents, actions, and views. Configure providers and leverage familiar Rails conventions.
- [Testing ActiveAgent Applications](https://docs.activeagents.ai/framework/testing): Testing strategies for ActiveAgent applications with credential management, VCR integration, and test patterns.

## Agents

- [Actions](https://docs.activeagents.ai/actions): Public methods in your agent that define specific AI behaviors using prompt() for text generation or embed() for vector embeddings.
- [Generation](https://docs.activeagents.ai/agents/generation): Execute AI generations synchronously with prompt_now or asynchronously with prompt_later using ActiveAgent's generation methods.
- [Agent Instructions](https://docs.activeagents.ai/agents/instructions): System-level messages that guide agent behavior, personality, capabilities, and tool usage. The agent's operating manual for every interaction.
- [Streaming](https://docs.activeagents.ai/agents/streaming): Stream responses from AI providers in real-time using callbacks that execute at different points in the streaming lifecycle.
- [Callbacks](https://docs.activeagents.ai/agents/callbacks): Control agent lifecycle with generation, prompting, embedding, and streaming callbacks for setup, validation, cleanup, and real-time response handling.
- [Error Handling](https://docs.activeagents.ai/agents/error_handling): Build resilient agents with automatic retries for network failures and application-level rescue handlers for custom error recovery.

## Actions

- [Messages](https://docs.activeagents.ai/actions/messages): Build conversation context with messages containing roles (user, assistant, system, tool) and content (text, images, documents) in native or unified format.
- [Embeddings](https://docs.activeagents.ai/actions/embeddings): Generate vector embeddings from text to enable semantic search, clustering, and similarity comparison in your AI applications.
- [Tools](https://docs.activeagents.ai/actions/tools): Extend agents with callable functions that LLMs can trigger during generation. Unified interface across providers for function calling.
- [Model Context Protocols (MCP)](https://docs.activeagents.ai/actions/mcps): Connect agents to external services and APIs using the Model Context Protocol. Universal integration for tools and data sources.
- [Structured Output](https://docs.activeagents.ai/actions/structured_output): Control JSON responses from AI models with json_object for simple output or json_schema for validated structured data.
- [Usage Statistics](https://docs.activeagents.ai/actions/usage): Track token usage and performance metrics across all AI providers with normalized usage objects.

## Providers

- [Anthropic Provider](https://docs.activeagents.ai/providers/anthropic): Integration with Claude models including Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and Opus 4.1. Advanced reasoning, extended context windows, thinking mode, and strong performance on complex tasks.
- [Ollama Provider](https://docs.activeagents.ai/providers/ollama): Local LLM inference using Ollama platform. Run Llama 3, Mistral, and Gemma locally without external APIs. Perfect for privacy-sensitive applications and development.
- [OpenAI Provider](https://docs.activeagents.ai/providers/open_ai): Integration with GPT models including GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and o3. Responses API with built-in tools or traditional Chat Completions API for standard interactions.
- [OpenRouter Provider](https://docs.activeagents.ai/providers/open_router): Access 200+ AI models from multiple providers through unified API. Intelligent routing, automatic fallbacks, multimodal support, PDF processing, and cost optimization.
- [Mock Provider](https://docs.activeagents.ai/providers/mock): Testing provider for developing and testing agents without API calls or costs. Returns predictable pig latin responses and generates random embeddings.
