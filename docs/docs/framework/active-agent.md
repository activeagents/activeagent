# Active Agent

Agents are Controllers that act as the core of the Active Agent framework. Active Agent manages AI-driven interactions, prompts, actions, and generative responses.

## Key Features
- **Prompt management**: Handle prompt-generation request-response cycles with structured prompts, messages, actions, and context.
- **Action methods**: Define public methods that become callable tools or functions for the Agent.
- **Generation providers**: Integrate with AI services like OpenAI or Anthropic.

## Example
```ruby
class TravelAgent < ApplicationAgent
  def search
    prompt(message: params[:message], content_type: :html)
  end

  def book
    prompt(message: params[:message], content_type: :json)
  end

  def confirm
    prompt(message: params[:message], content_type: :text)
  end
end
```
